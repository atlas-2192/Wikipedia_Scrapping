The following <strong>list of cat breeds</strong> includes domestic cat <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breed">breed</a>s and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Felid_hybrid#Domestic_Cat_.26_hybridization">domestic/wild hybrids</a>. The list includes established breeds recognized by various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cat_registry">cat registries</a>, new and experimental breeds, distinct domestic populations not being actively developed, and lapsed breeds.
Inconsistency in breed classification among registries means that an individual animal may be considered different breeds by different registries. For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_International_Cat_Association">The International Cat Association</a>s Himalayan is considered a colorpoint version of the Persian by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_Fanciers_Association">Cat Fanciers Association</a> while the CFA&apos;s Javanese is considered a color variation of the Balinese by TICA.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domestic_short-haired">domestic short-haired</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domestic_long-haired_cat">domestic long-haired cat</a> are not breeds but terms used in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cat_fancy">cat fancy</a> to describe cats of a general type that do not belong to a particular breed.

This is a <strong>list of domestic breeds of sheep</strong>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_sheep">Domestic sheep</a> (<em>Ovis aries</em>) are partially derived from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mouflon">mouflon</a> (<em>Ovis orientalis</em>) stock, and have diverged sufficiently to be considered a different species.
Over 800 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breeds">breeds</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cattle">cattle</a> are recognized worldwide, some of which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adaptation">adapted</a> to the local <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/climate">climate</a>, others which were bred by humans for specialized uses.<ref><a href="http://www.ecoshelters.com.au/bulletins/cattlebreeds.html">Cattle Breeds of the World</a></ref>
Breeds fall into two main types, regarded as either two closely related <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/species">species</a>, or two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subspecies">subspecies</a> of one species.  <em>Bos indicus</em> (or <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bos_taurus_indicus">Bos taurus indicus</a></em>) cattle, also called zebu, are adapted to hot climates.  <em>Bos taurus</em> (or <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bos_taurus_taurus">Bos taurus taurus</a></em>) are the typical cattle of Europe, north-eastern Asia, and parts of Africa &#x2013; they are referred to in this list as &quot;taurine&quot; cattle, and many are adapted to cooler climates.  <em>Taurus/indicus</em> hybrids are widely bred in many warmer regions, combining characteristics of both the ancestral types (such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanga_cattle">Sanga cattle</a> of Africa).
In some parts of the world further species of cattle are found (both as wild and domesticated animals), and some of these are related so closely to taurine and indicus cattle that inter<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/species">species</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)">hybrids</a> have been bred.

The <strong>African buffalo</strong> or <strong>Cape buffalo</strong> (<em>Syncerus caffer</em>), is a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa">Africa</a>n bovine.(ref: MSW3) It is not closely related to the slightly larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wild_Asian_water_buffalo">wild Asian water buffalo</a>, and its ancestry remains unclear. <em>Syncerus caffer caffer</em>, the Cape buffalo, is the typical subspecies, and the largest one, found in South and East Africa.  <em>S. c. nanus</em> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Forest_Buffalo">forest buffalo</a>) is the smallest subspecies, common in forest areas of Central and West Africa while  <em>S. c. brachyceros</em> is in West Africa and <em>S. c.  aequinoctialis</em> is in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/savannas">savannas</a> of Central Africa. The adult buffalo&apos;s horns are its characteristic feature; they have fused bases, forming a continuous bone shield referred to as a &quot;boss&quot;.  It is widely regarded as a very dangerous animal, as it gores and kills over 200 people every year. 
The African buffalo is not an ancestor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle">domestic cattle</a>, and is only distantly related to other larger bovines. Owing to its unpredictable nature, which makes it highly dangerous to humans, the African buffalo has never been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domesticated">domesticated</a> unlike its Asian counterpart, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_buffalo">water buffalo</a>.

Two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extant_taxon">extant</a> and four <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extinction">extinct</a> species are recognized.

Of the two surviving species, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_bison">American bison</a>, <em>B. bison</em>, found only in North America, is the more numerous. Although sometimes referred to historically as a &quot;buffalo&quot;, it is only distantly related to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_buffalo">true buffalo</a>. The North American species is composed of two subspecies, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plains_bison">plains bison</a>, <em>B. b. bison</em>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wood_bison">wood bison</a>, <em>B. b. athabascae</em>, which is the namesake of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_Buffalo_National_Park">Wood Buffalo National Park</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</a>.

They have various methods of social organization and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/social_behaviour">social behaviour</a>, which are classified into solitary and gregarious behaviour. Bovids use different forms of vocal, olfactory, and tangible communication. Most species alternately feed and ruminate throughout the day. While small bovids forage in dense and closed habitat, larger species feed upon high-fiber vegetation in open grasslands. Most bovids are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polygynous_mating_systems">polygynous</a>.  Mature bovids mate at least once a year, and smaller species may even mate twice.  In some species,neonate bovids remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers; in other species, neonates are followers, accompanying their dams, rather than tending to remain hidden.
Most of the diverse bovid species occur in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa">Africa</a>. The maximum concentration is in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/savanna">savanna</a>s of eastern Africa. A few bovid species also occur in Europe, Asia, and North America.

The bobcat is an adaptable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/predator">predator</a> that inhabits wooded areas, as well as semidesert, urban edge, forest edges, and swampland environments. It remains in some of its original range, but local populations are vulnerable to extirpation by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coyote">coyote</a>s and domestic animals. The bobcat is vital for controlling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pest_(organism)">pest</a> populations. 
With a gray to brown coat, whiskered face, and black-tufted ears, the bobcat resembles the other species of the mid-sized <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx">Lynx</a></em> genus. It is smaller on average than the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_lynx">Canada lynx</a>, with which it shares parts of its range, but is about twice as large as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cat">domestic cat</a>. It has distinctive black bars on its forelegs and a black-tipped, stubby tail, from which it derives its name.
Though the bobcat prefers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rabbit">rabbit</a>s and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hare">hare</a>s, it will hunt anything from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insect">insect</a>s, chickens, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/goose">geese</a> and other birds and small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rodent">rodent</a>s to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deer">deer</a>. Prey selection depends on location and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/habitat">habitat</a>, season, and abundance. Like most cats, the bobcat is territorial and largely solitary, although with some overlap in home ranges. It uses several methods to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/territorial_marking">mark its territorial boundaries</a>, including claw marks and deposits of urine or feces. The bobcat breeds from winter into spring and has a gestation period of about two months.
Although bobcats have been hunted extensively by humans, both for sport and fur, their population has proven resilient though declining in some areas.

Adult butterflies have large, often brightly coloured wings, and conspicuous, fluttering flight. The group comprises the large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/superfamily_(zoology)">superfamily</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papilionoidea">Papilionoidea</a>, along with two smaller groups, the skippers (superfamily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesperioidea">Hesperioidea</a>) and the moth-butterflies (superfamily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedyloidea">Hedyloidea</a>). Butterfly fossils date to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palaeocene">Palaeocene</a>, about 56 million years ago.
Butterflies have the typical four-stage insect life cycle. Winged adults lay eggs on the food plant on which their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/larva">larva</a>e, known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caterpillar">caterpillar</a>s, will feed. The caterpillars grow, sometimes very rapidly, and when fully developed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pupa">pupa</a>te in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chrysalis">chrysalis</a>. When <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a> is complete, the pupal skin splits, the adult insect climbs out and, after its wings have expanded and dried, it flies off. Some butterflies, especially in the tropics, have several generations in a year, while others have a single generation, and a few in cold locations may take several years to pass through their whole life cycle.
Butterflies are often <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymorphism_(biology)">polymorphic</a>, and many species make use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camouflage">camouflage</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mimicry">mimicry</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aposematism">aposematism</a> to evade their predators.

Some butterflies have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitoid">parasitoidal</a> relationships with organisms including protozoans, flies, ants, and other invertebrates, and are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation">predated</a> by vertebrates. Some species are pests because in their larval stages they can damage domestic crops or trees; other species are agents of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pollination">pollination</a> of some plants, and caterpillars of a few butterflies (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miletinae">harvesters</a>) eat harmful insects.

Size can range from a few millimetres in the smaller lithobiomorphs and geophilomorphs to about [30cmabbr=on] in the largest scolopendromorphs. Centipedes can be found in a wide variety of environments. Centipedes normally have a drab coloration combining shades of brown and red.

<strong>Caribou</strong> (North America) refers to any of several North American subspecies, ecotypes, populations, and herds[CroninMacNeilPatton2005] of the species <em>Rangifer tarandus</em>.[Klein1980] In North America caribou range in size from the smallest, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peary_caribou">Peary caribou</a>, to the largest, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/boreal_woodland_caribou">boreal woodland caribou</a>. The North American range of caribou extends from Alaska, through the Yukon, the Northwest Territories, Nunavut, into the boreal forest and south through the Canadian Rockies and the Columbia and Selkirk Mountains.[Eder2011page=81] Barren-ground, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcupine_caribou">Porcupine caribou</a> and Peary caribou live in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tundra">tundra</a> while the shy woodland caribou, prefers the boreal forest. Two major subspecies in North America, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porcupine_caribou"><em>R. t. granti</em></a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barren-ground_caribou"><em>R. t. groenlandicus</em></a> form large herds and undertake lengthy seasonal migrations from birthing grounds, to summer and winter feeding grounds in the tundra and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taiga">taiga</a>. The migrations of <em>R. t. granti</em> Porcupine herds are among the longest of any terrestrial mammal.[Eder2011page=81] Barren-land caribou are also found in western Greenland, but the larger herds are in Alaska, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut.[Grubb2005]
The circumpolar species itself, <em>Rangifer tarandus</em>, at a global level, is listed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (ICUN) &quot;as Least Concern due to a wide circumpolar distribution and presumed large populations.&quot;[HenttonenTikhonov2008] The populations of subspecies, ecotypes, populations and herds of caribou in North America are in decline[Nunatsiaq News2013][Campbell2010][McCloskey2011page=76] and one subspecies, the iconic boreal woodland caribou, has been listed by COSEWIC as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threatened_species">threatened</a> since 2002.[COSEWIC2011]
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_River_(Quebec)">George River caribou herd</a> (GRCH), in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungava_Peninsula">Ungava</a> region of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec">Quebec</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador">Labrador</a> in eastern Canada was once the world&apos;s largest herd with 800&#x2009;000&#x2013;900&#x2009;000 animals.  By 2012 the herd numbered 27&#x2009;600 and declined to 14&#x2009;200 animals in 2014.(ref: DoENfld_2014)
The meta-population of the more sedentary subspecies <em>R. t. caribou</em> or woodland caribou spans the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreal_forest_of_Canada">boreal forest</a> from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Territories">Northwest Territories</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labrador">Labrador</a>. They are shy animals whose main food source is arboreal lichens[McCloskey2011page=76] of the mature forests[CPAWSNWT2010] and mainly live in marshes, bogs, lakes, and river regions.[Natural Resources Canada2000page=14][CullingCulling2006page=1] Since it takes hundreds of years for a biomass of tree lichen to be adequate to sustain boreal woodland caribou populations, deforestation is a major factor in the decline of their numbers.[McCloskey2011page=76] The historic range of the boreal woodland caribou covered over half of present-day Canada,[Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society and The David Suzuki Foundation2013] stretching from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska">Alaska</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_and_Labrador">Newfoundland and Labrador</a> and as far south as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_England">New England</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idaho">Idaho</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_(state)">Washington</a>. The smallest subspecies in North America, the Peary caribou is found in the High and Low Arctic, in the Northwest Territories&#x2014;particularly, Banks Island and in Nunavut&#x2014;particularly, Baffin Island.
The caribou is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalist_and_specialist_species">specialist</a> that is well adapted to cooler climates with hollow-hair fur that covers almost all of its body including its nose, and provides insulation in winter and flotation for swimming.[Eder2011page=81] Caribou can reach a speed of [60-80km/habbr=on]. Young caribou can already outrun an Olympic sprinter when only a day old.[Hoare2009] The caribou&apos;s favourite winter food is fruticose <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladonia_rangiferina">deer lichen</a>. Seventy percent of the diet of woodland caribou consists of arboreal lichen which take hundreds of years to grow and are therefore only found in mature forests.[CPAWSNWT2010]
Although there are many variations in colour and size, <em>Canadian Geographic</em> magazine states that in general, barren-ground caribou have larger antlers than the woodland caribou subspecies. Barren-ground caribou have large distinguishing white patches of fur that extend beyond the neck onto the back, a white muzzle and a face that is darker than the rest of the body. Their fur is sandy-beige in winter and light brown in summer. The woodland caribou have a wider more compact body and wider antlers. The coat is a rich dark brown in summer and dark grey in winter. Both the barren-ground and woodland caribou often have white &quot;socks&quot; above their hooves.[Canadian Geographic2007] On average the male weighs [90-110kglbabbr=on] and measures [0.9-1.7mftabbr=on] in shoulder height. The woodland caribou are the largest and the Peary caribou the smallest. The largest Alaskan male Porcupine caribou can weigh as much as [310kglb].
Female caribou can live up to 17 years and male caribou for four years less.[Bergerud2014]
Both sexes grow <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antler">antler</a>s, though in a some woodland caribou populations, females lack antlers completely. Antlers are larger in males.
Caribou are an integral part of First Nations and Inuit oral histories and legends including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwich&apos;in">Gwich&apos;in</a> creation story of how Gwich&#x2019;in people and the caribou separated from a single entity.[First Voices2014]

The <strong>dingo</strong> (<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_lupus_dingo">Canis lupus dingo</a></em>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/free-ranging_dog">free-ranging dog</a> found mainly in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_(continent)">Australia</a>. Its exact ancestry is debated, but dingoes are generally believed to be descended from semi-domesticated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dog">dog</a>s from East or South Asia, which returned to a wild lifestyle when introduced to Australia. As such, it is currently classified as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies_of_Canis_lupus">subspecies of the grey wolf</a>, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canis_lupus">Canis lupus</a></em>. The Australian name has therefore sometimes been applied to similar dogs in Southeast Asia or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Dog">America</a> believed to be close relatives. As free-ranging animals, they are not considered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taming">tame</a>, although tame dingoes and dingo-dog hybrids have been bred.
The dingo&apos;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/habitat">habitat</a> ranges from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/desert">desert</a>s to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grassland">grassland</a>s and the edges of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forest">forest</a>s. Dingoes will normally make their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/burrow">dens</a> in deserted rabbit holes and hollow logs close to an essential supply of water.
The dingo is the largest terrestrial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/predation">predator</a> in Australia, and plays an important role as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apex_predator">apex predator</a>. However, the dingo is seen as a pest by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/livestock">livestock</a> farmers due to attacks on animals. Conversely, their predation on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rabbit">rabbit</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kangaroo">kangaroo</a>s and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rat">rat</a>s may be of benefit to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastoral_farming">graziers</a>.
For many Australians, the dingo is a cultural icon.

Despite being an efficient hunter, it is listed as vulnerable to extinction.

Using fossil evidence, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/paleontology">paleontologists</a> have identified over 500 distinct <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genus">genera</a> and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extant_taxon">extant</a> species and fossil remains. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous. While dinosaurs were ancestrally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bipedalism">bipedal</a>, many extinct groups included <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/quadrupedalism">quadrupedal</a> species, and some were able to shift between these stances.

Still, the idea that non-avian dinosaurs were uniformly gigantic is a misconception based in part on preservation bias, as large, sturdy bones are more likely to last until they are fossilized. Many dinosaurs were quite small: <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xixianykus">Xixianykus</a></em>, for example, was only about [50cminabbr=on] long.
Although the word <em>dinosaur</em> means &quot;terrible lizard&quot;, the name is somewhat misleading, as dinosaurs are not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lizards">lizards</a>. Instead, they represent a separate group of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reptiles">reptiles</a> that, like many extinct forms, did not exhibit characteristics traditionally seen as reptilian, such as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_locomotion#Posture">sprawling limb posture</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ectothermy">ectothermy</a>. Additionally, many prehistoric animals, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mosasaur">mosasaur</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ichthyosaur">ichthyosaur</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pterosaur">pterosaur</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plesiosaur">plesiosaur</a>s, and <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimetrodon">Dimetrodon</a></em>, are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, but are not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxonomy_(biology)">taxonomically</a> classified as dinosaurs. Through the first half of the 20th century, before birds were recognized to be dinosaurs, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs to have been sluggish and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poikilotherm">cold-blooded</a>. Most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_renaissance">research conducted since the 1970s</a>, however, has indicated that all dinosaurs were active animals with elevated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metabolism">metabolism</a>s and numerous adaptations for social interaction.
Since the first dinosaur <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fossil">fossil</a>s were recognized in the early 19th century, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons have been major attractions at museums around the world, and dinosaurs have become an enduring part of world culture. The large sizes of some groups, as well as their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature, have ensured dinosaurs<em>regular appearance in best-selling books and films, such as </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)">Jurassic Park</a>. Persistent public enthusiasm for the animals has resulted in significant funding for dinosaur science, and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media.

The two most important species of cod are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_cod">Atlantic cod</a> (<em>Gadus morhua</em>), which lives in the colder waters and deeper sea regions throughout the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic">North Atlantic</a>, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_cod">Pacific cod</a> (<em>Gadus macrocephalus</em>), found in both eastern and western regions of the northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</a>. <em>Gadus morhua</em> was named by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Linnaeus">Linnaeus</a> in 1758. (However, <em>G. morhua callarias</em>, a low-salinity, non-migratory <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies">race</a> restricted to parts of the Baltic, was originally described as <em>Gadus callarias</em> by Linnaeus.)

They typically live in compact <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_(biology)">colonies</a> of many identical individual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polyp">polyp</a>s. The group includes the important <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_reef">reef</a> builders that inhabit tropical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ocean">ocean</a>s and secrete <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/calcium_carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> to form a hard skeleton.
A coral &quot;head&quot; is a colony of myriad <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cloning">genetically identical</a> polyps. Each polyp is a sac-like animal typically only a few millimeters in diameter and a few centimeters in length. A set of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tentacle">tentacle</a>s surround a central mouth opening. An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/exoskeleton">exoskeleton</a> is excreted near the base. Over many generations, the colony thus creates a large skeleton that is characteristic of the species. Individual heads grow by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/asexual_reproduction">asexual reproduction</a> of polyps. Corals also breed sexually by spawning: polyps of the same species release <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gamete">gamete</a>s simultaneously over a period of one to several nights around a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/full_moon">full moon</a>.

These are commonly known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zooxanthellae">zooxanthellae</a> and the corals that contain them are zooxanthellate corals. Such corals require sunlight and grow in clear, shallow water, typically at depths shallower than [60m]. Corals are major contributors to the physical structure of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coral_reef">coral reef</a>s that develop in tropical and subtropical waters, such as the enormous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a> off the coast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland">Queensland</a>, Australia.

They are small-sized birds overall, usually having the crown of the head and throat patch distinctly darker than the body. They are at least 6 to 14 centimeters in size.

It has a central and a peripheral nervous system. The central nervous system consists of two ganglia above the mouth, one on either side, connected to a nerve cord running back along its length to motor neurons and sensory cells in each segment. Large numbers of chemoreceptors are concentrated near its mouth. Circumferential and longitudinal muscles on the periphery of each segment enable the worm to move. Similar sets of muscles line the gut, and their actions move the digesting food toward the worm&apos;s anus.(ref: Integrated Principles of Zoology)<span class="reference" data-type="book" data-authors="Cleveland P.

&quot;Earthworm&quot; is the common name for the largest members of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oligochaeta">Oligochaeta</a> (which is either a class or a subclass depending on the author). In classical systems, they were placed in the order Opisthopora, on the basis of the male pores opening posterior to the female pores, though the internal male segments are anterior to the female. Theoretical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cladistics">cladistic</a> studies have placed them, instead, in the suborder Lumbricina of the order Haplotaxida, but this may again soon change. Folk names for the earthworm include &quot;dew-worm&quot;, &quot;rainworm&quot;, &quot;night crawler&quot;, and &quot;angleworm&quot; (due to its use as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fishing_bait">fishing bait</a>).

All species are native to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas">Americas</a>, where they inhabit a variety of environments.
Like all other xenarthran lineages, armadillos originated in South America. Due to the continent&apos;s former isolation, they were confined there for most of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenozoic">Cenozoic</a>. The recent formation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isthmus_of_Panama">Isthmus of Panama</a> allowed a few members of the family to migrate northward into southern North America by the early <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleistocene">Pleistocene</a>, as part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Interchange">Great American Interchange</a>.(ref: Woodburne2010)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cingulata">cingulate</a> relatives, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pampathere">pampathere</a>s and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/glyptodont">glyptodont</a>s, made the same journey.(ref: Woodburne2010)
Today, all extant armadillo species are still present in South America. They are particularly diverse in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay">Paraguay</a> (where eleven species exist) and surrounding areas. Many species are endangered. Some, including four species of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasypus">Dasypus</a></em>, are widely distributed over the Americas, whereas others, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yepes&apos;s_mulita">Yepes&apos;s mulita</a>, are restricted to small ranges.

Ferrets are sexually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_dimorphism">dimorphic</a> predators with males being substantially larger than females.

Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/salamander">salamander</a>s and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frog">frog</a>s lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reptile">reptile</a>s but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/amniote">amniote</a>s and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecological_indicator">ecological indicator</a>s and in recent decades there has been a dramatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/decline_in_amphibian_populations">decline in amphibian populations</a> for many species around the globe.
The earliest amphibians <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evolution_of_tetrapods">evolved</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devonian">Devonian</a> period from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sarcopterygian">sarcopterygian</a> fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry land. They diversified and became dominant during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carboniferous">Carboniferous</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian">Permian</a> periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates. Over time, amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissamphibia">Lissamphibia</a>. The three modern orders of amphibians are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anura_(frog)">Anura</a> (the frogs and toads), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urodela">Urodela</a> (the salamanders), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caecilian">Apoda</a> (the caecilians). The number of known amphibian species is approximately 7,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs. The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a frog from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea">New Guinea</a> (<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paedophryne_amauensis">Paedophryne amauensis</a></em>) with a length of just [7.7mminabbr=on]. The largest living amphibian is the [1.8m0abbr=on] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_giant_salamander">Chinese giant salamander</a> (<em>Andrias davidianus</em>), but this is dwarfed by the extinct [9m0abbr=on] <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prionosuchus">Prionosuchus</a></em> from the middle Permian of Brazil. The study of amphibians is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/batrachology">batrachology</a>, while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herpetology">herpetology</a>.
<strong>Elephants</strong> are large mammals of the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephantidae">Elephantidae</a> and the order <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proboscidea">Proboscidea</a>. Two species are traditionally recognised, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_elephant">African elephant</a> (<em>Loxodonta africana</em>) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_elephant">Asian elephant</a> (<em>Elephas maximus</em>), although some evidence suggests that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_bush_elephant">African bush elephant</a>s and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_forest_elephant">African forest elephant</a>s are separate species (<em>L.&#xA0;africana</em> and <em>L.&#xA0;cyclotis</em> respectively). Elephants are scattered throughout <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sub-Saharan_Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Asia">South Asia</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. Elephantidae is the only surviving family of the order Proboscidea; other, now extinct, members of the order include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinotheriidae">deinotheres</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gomphothere">gomphothere</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mammoth">mammoth</a>s, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mastodon">mastodon</a>s. Male African elephants are the largest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extant_taxon">extant</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrestrial_animal">terrestrial animal</a>s and can reach a height of [4mft0abbr=on] and weigh [7000kglb-3abbr=on]. All elephants have several distinctive features the most notable of which is a long trunk or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/proboscis">proboscis</a>, used for many purposes, particularly breathing, lifting water and grasping objects.  Their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/incisor">incisor</a>s grow into tusks, which can serve as weapons and as tools for moving objects and digging. Elephants&apos; large ear flaps help to control their body temperature. Their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/column">pillar</a>-like legs can carry their great weight. African elephants have larger ears and concave backs while Asian elephants have smaller ears and convex or level backs.
Elephants are herbivorous and can be found in different habitats including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/savanna">savanna</a>hs, forests, deserts and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marsh">marsh</a>es. They prefer to stay near water. They are considered to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keystone_species">keystone species</a> due to their impact on their environments. Other animals tend to keep their distance; predators such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lion">lion</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiger">tiger</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hyena">hyena</a>s and wild <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canidae">dogs</a> usually target only the young elephants (or &quot;calves&quot;). Females (&quot;cows&quot;) tend to live in family groups, which can consist of one female with her calves or several related females with offspring. The groups are led by an individual known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matriarchy">matriarch</a>, often the oldest cow.  Elephants have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fission-fusion_society">fission-fusion society</a> in which multiple family groups come together to socialise. Males (&quot;bulls&quot;) leave their family groups when they reach puberty, and may live alone or with other males. Adult bulls mostly interact with family groups when looking for a mate and enter a state of increased <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/testosterone">testosterone</a> and aggression known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/musth">musth</a>, which helps them gain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominance_(ethology)">dominance</a> and reproductive success. Calves are the centre of attention in their family groups and rely on their mothers for as long as three years. Elephants can live up to 70 years in the wild. They communicate by touch, sight, smell and sound; elephants use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infrasound">infrasound</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seismic_communication">seismic communication</a> over long distances. Elephant intelligence has been compared with that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/primate">primate</a>s and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cetacea">cetacea</a>ns. They appear to have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-awareness">self-awareness</a> and show <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/empathy">empathy</a> for dying or dead individuals of their kind.
African elephants are listed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species">vulnerable</a> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), while the Asian elephant is classed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species">endangered</a>. One of the biggest threats to elephant populations is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivory_trade">ivory trade</a>, as the animals are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poaching">poached</a> for their ivory tusks. Other threats to wild elephants include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/habitat_destruction">habitat destruction</a> and conflicts with local people. Elephants are used as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/working_animal">working animal</a>s in Asia. In the past they were used in war; today, they are often put on display in zoos and circuses. Elephants are highly recognisable and have been featured in art, folklore, religion, literature and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/popular_culture">popular culture</a>.

Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/binomial_nomenclature">species name</a> refers to its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camel">camel</a>-like shape and its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopard">leopard</a>-like colouring. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ossicone">ossicone</a>s, and its distinctive coat patterns. It is classified under the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)">family</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giraffidae">Giraffidae</a>, along with its closest extant relative, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/okapi">okapi</a>. The nine subspecies are distinguished by their coat patterns.
The giraffe&apos;s scattered range extends from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad">Chad</a> in the north to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a> in the south, and from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger">Niger</a> in the west to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somalia">Somalia</a> in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/savanna">savanna</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grassland">grassland</a>s, and open <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/woodland">woodland</a>s. Their primary food source is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimosoideae#Acacieae">acacia</a> leaves, which they browse at heights most other herbivores cannot reach. Giraffes are preyed on by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lion">lion</a>s; their calves are also targeted by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopard">leopard</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spotted_hyena">spotted hyena</a>s, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycaon_pictus">wild dog</a>s. Adult giraffes do not have strong social bonds, though they do gather in loose aggregations if they happen to be moving in the same general direction. Males establish social hierarchies through &quot;necking&quot;, which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominance_(ethology)">Dominant</a> males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.

The physical traits used to distinguish chicken breeds are size, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plumage">plumage</a> color, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comb_(anatomy)">comb</a> type, skin color, number of toes, amount of feathering, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_(biology)">egg</a> color, and place of origin.(ref: Ekarius 2007 23)(ref: Ekarius 2007 23)
In the 21st century, chickens are frequently bred according to predetermined <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breed_standard">breed standard</a>s set down by governing organizations. The first of such standards was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Poultry_Standard">British Poultry Standard</a>, which is still in publication today.(ref: Ekarius 2007)(ref: Heinrichs 2007) Other standards include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_of_Perfection">Standard of Perfection</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Poultry_Standard">Australian Poultry Standard</a>, and the standard of the American Bantam Association, which deals exclusively with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantam_chicken">bantam</a> fowl.(ref: Heinrichs 2007)<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livestock_show">shown</a> competitively. There are additionally a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)">hybrid</a> strains which are common in the poultry world, especially in large poultry farms. These types are first generation crosses of true breeds. Hybrids do not reliably pass on their features to their offspring, but are highly valued for their producing abilities.(ref: Ekarius 2007 23)

The <strong>elk</strong> or <strong>wapiti</strong> (<em>Cervus canadensis</em>) is one of the largest species within the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cervidae">Cervidae</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/deer">deer</a> family in the world, and one of the largest land <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mammal">mammal</a>s in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America">North America</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia">eastern Asia</a>. This animal should not be confused with the larger <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moose">moose</a> (<em>Alces alces</em>), to which the name &quot;elk&quot; applies in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles">British Isles</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia">Eurasia</a>. Apart from the moose, the only other member of the deer family to rival the elk in size is the south Asian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sambar_(deer)">sambar</a> (<em>Rusa unicolor</em>).
Elk range in forest and forest-edge habitat, feeding on grasses, plants, leaves and bark. Male elk have large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antler">antler</a>s which are shed each year. Males also engage in ritualized mating behaviors during the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rut_(mammalian_reproduction)">rut</a>, including posturing, antler wrestling (sparring), and <em>bugling</em>, a loud series of vocalizations which establishes dominance over other males and attracts females.
Although native to North America and eastern Asia, they have adapted well to countries where they have been introduced, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina">Argentina</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a>. Their great adaptability may threaten <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/endemism">endemic</a> species and ecosystems into which they have been introduced. Elk are susceptible to a number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/infectious_disease">infectious disease</a>s, some of which can be transmitted to livestock. Efforts to eliminate infectious diseases from elk populations, largely through vaccination, have had mixed success.
Some cultures revere the elk as a spiritual force. In parts of Asia, antlers and their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/velvet_(antler_covering)">velvet</a> are used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/traditional_medicine">traditional medicine</a>s. Elk are hunted as a game species; the meat is leaner and higher in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/protein">protein</a> than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beef">beef</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicken">chicken</a>.<ref name="Robb"><span class="reference" data-type="book " data-="" last="Robb " first="Bob " data-author2="Bethge, Gerald " title="The Ultimate Guide to Elk Hunting " publisher="The Lyons Press " year=" 2001" isbn="1-58574-180-9 " oclc="44818360 "></span></ref>

At around the size of a domestic chicken, kiwi are by far the smallest living <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ratite">ratite</a>s (which also consist of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ostrich">ostrich</a>es, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/emu">emu</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhea_(bird)">rhea</a>s, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassowary">cassowaries</a>), and lay the largest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_egg">egg</a> in relation to their body size of any species of bird in the world.<ref><span class="reference" data-type="web" data-url="http://www.sandiegozoo.org/animalbytes/t-kiwi.html" data-publisher="&lt;a href=" http:="" en.wikipedia.org="" wiki="" san_diego_zoo"="">San Diego Zoo&quot; data-accessdate=&quot;2008-09-19&quot;&gt;Birds: Kiwi</span></ref> DNA sequence comparisons have yielded the surprising conclusion that kiwi are much more closely related to the extinct Malagasy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elephant_bird">elephant bird</a>s than to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moa">moa</a> with which they shared New Zealand. There are five recognised species, two of which are currently <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species">vulnerable</a>, one of which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_species">endangered</a>, and one of which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/critically_endangered">critically endangered</a>. All species have been negatively affected by historic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation_in_New_Zealand">deforestation</a> but currently the remaining large areas of their forest habitat are well protected in reserves and national parks. At present, the greatest threat to their survival is predation by invasive mammalian predators.
The kiwi is a national symbol of New Zealand, and the association is so strong that the term <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_(people)">Kiwi</a></em> is used internationally as the colloquial <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/demonym">demonym</a> for New Zealanders.<ref><span class="reference" data-type="web" data-url="http://glossary.immigration.govt.nz/Kiwis.htm " data-publisher="Glossary.immigration.govt.nz " data-date=" " data-accessdate="2012-09-13">Kiwis/Kiwi - New Zealand Immigration Service (Summary of Terms) </span></ref>
The <strong>Galliformes</strong> are an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/order_(biology)">order</a> of heavy-bodied ground-feeding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bird">bird</a>s that includes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turkey_(bird)">turkey</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grouse">grouse</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chicken">chicken</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_quail">New World quail</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World_quail">Old World quail</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagopus">ptarmigan</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/partridge">partridge</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pheasant">pheasant</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/junglefowl">junglefowl</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracidae">Cracidae</a>.  The name derives from &quot;gallus&quot;, Latin for &quot;cock&quot; or &quot;rooster&quot;. Common names are <strong>gamefowl</strong> or <strong>gamebirds</strong>, <strong>landfowl</strong>, <strong>gallinaceous birds</strong>, or <strong>galliforms</strong>. &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildfowl">Wildfowl</a>&quot; or just &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fowl">fowl</a>&quot; are also often used for the Galliformes, but usually these terms also refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/waterfowl">waterfowl</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anseriformes">Anseriformes</a>), and occasionally to other commonly hunted birds.  This group has about 290 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/species">species</a>, one or more of which are found in essentially every part of the world&apos;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/continent">continent</a>s (except for the innermost <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/desert">desert</a>s and perpetual <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ice">ice</a>).  They are rarer on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/island">island</a>s, and in contrast to the closely related waterfowl, are essentially absent from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ocean">ocean</a>ic islands&#x2014;unless introduced there by humans.  Several species have been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domesticated">domesticated</a> during their long and extensive relationships with humans.
This order contains five <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_(biology)">families</a>: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phasianidae">Phasianidae</a> (including chicken, quail, partridges, pheasants, turkeys, peafowl and grouse), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontophoridae">Odontophoridae</a> (New World quails), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numididae">Numididae</a> (guineafowl), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cracidae">Cracidae</a> (including chachalacas and curassows), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megapodiidae">Megapodiidae</a> (incubator birds like mallee fowl and brush-turkeys). They are important as seed dispersers and predators in the ecosystems they inhabit, and are often reared as game birds by humans for their meat and eggs and for recreational hunting.  Many gallinaceous species are skilled runners and escape predators by running rather than flying.  Males of most species are more colorful than the females.  Males often have elaborate courtship behaviors that include strutting, fluffing of tail or head feathers, and vocal sounds. They are mainly nonmigratory.
<strong>Hornets</strong> are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insect">insect</a>s, and the largest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eusociality">eusocial</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wasp">wasp</a>s. Some species can reach up to [5.5cmin1abbr=on] in length. The true hornets make up the genus <strong><em>Vespa</em></strong> and are distinguished from other <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vespine">vespine</a>s by the width of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vertex_(anatomy)">vertex</a> (part of the head behind the eyes), which is proportionally larger in <em>Vespa</em> and by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anteriorly">anteriorly</a> rounded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gaster_(insect_anatomy)">gasters</a> (the section of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/abdomen">abdomen</a> behind the wasp waist). The best known species is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_hornet">European hornet</a> (<em>Vespa crabro</em>), about 2&#x2013;3.5&#xA0;cm in length, widely distributed throughout <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe">Europe</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia">Russia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America">North America</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Asia">Northeast Asia</a>. Most species make exposed nests in trees and shrubs, but some (like <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespa_orientalis">Vespa orientalis</a></em>) build their nests underground or in other cavities.
<strong>Hamsters</strong> are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rodent">rodent</a>s belonging to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subfamily">subfamily</a> <strong>Cricetinae</strong>. The subfamily contains about 25 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/species">species</a>, classified in six or seven <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genus">genera</a>.(ref: Fox) They have become established as popular small house <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pet">pet</a>s and partly because they are easy to breed in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/captivity_(animal)">captivity</a>, hamsters are often used as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/animal_testing">laboratory animals</a>.
In the wild, hamsters are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crepuscular">crepuscular</a> and remain underground during the day to avoid being caught by predators. They feed primarily on seeds, fruits, and vegetation, and will occasionally eat burrowing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insect">insect</a>s.<ref><span class="reference" data-type="book" data-author="Patricia Pope Bartlett" data-url="http://books.google.com/books?id" data-date="2003" data-publisher="Barron&apos;s Educational Series" data-isbn="978-0-7641-2294-1" data-page="[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id">The Hamster Handbook</span></ref> They have elongated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cheek_pouch">cheek pouch</a>es extending to their shoulders in which they carry food back to their burrows.
Hamster <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/behavior">behavior</a> varies depending on their environment, genetics, and interaction with people.
<strong>Hoverflies</strong>, sometimes called <strong>flower flies</strong>, <strong>sweat bees</strong> or <strong>syrphid flies</strong>, make up the insect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/family_(biology)">family</a> <strong>Syrphidae</strong>. As their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_name">common name</a> suggests, they are often seen hovering or nectaring at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flower">flower</a>s; the adults of many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/species">species</a> feed mainly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nectar">nectar</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pollen">pollen</a>, while the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/larva">larva</a>e (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/maggot">maggot</a>s) eat a wide range of foods. In some species, the larvae are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saprotroph">saprotroph</a>s, eating decaying plant and animal matter in the soil or in ponds and streams. In other species, the larvae are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insectivore">insectivore</a>s and prey on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aphid">aphid</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/thrip">thrip</a>s, and other plant-sucking insects.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphid">Aphid</a>s alone cause tens of millions of dollars of damage to crops worldwide every year; because of this, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/aphidophagous">aphid-eating</a> hoverflies are being recognized as important <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation">natural enemies</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pest_(organism)">pests</a>, and potential agents for use in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biological_control">biological control</a>. Some adult syrphid flies are important <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pollinator">pollinator</a>s.
About 6,000 species in 200 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genus">genera</a> have been described. Hoverflies are common throughout the world and can be found on all continents except <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica">Antarctica</a>. Hoverflies are harmless to most other animals, despite their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batesian_mimicry">mimicry</a> of more dangerous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wasp">wasp</a>s and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bee">bee</a>s, which wards off predators.

<strong>Kingfishers</strong> are a group of small to medium-sized brightly colored <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bird">bird</a>s in the order <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coraciiformes">Coraciiformes</a>. They have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cosmopolitan_distribution">cosmopolitan distribution</a>, with most species found outside of the Americas. The group is treated either as a single <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/family_(biology)">family</a>, Alcedinidae, or as a suborder <strong>Alcedines</strong> containing three families, Alcedinidae (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/river_kingfisher">river kingfisher</a>s), Halcyonidae (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tree_kingfisher">tree kingfisher</a>s), and Cerylidae (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/water_kingfisher">water kingfisher</a>s). There are roughly 90 species of kingfisher. All have large heads, long, sharp, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. Most species have bright <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plumage">plumage</a> with little differences between the sexes. Most species are tropical in distribution, and a slight majority are found only in forests. They consume a wide range of prey as well as fish, usually caught by swooping down from a perch. While kingfishers are usually thought to live near rivers and eat fish, most of the kingfisher species in the world live away from water and eat small invertebrates. Like other members of their order they nest in cavities, usually tunnels dug into the natural or artificial banks in the ground. A quarter of all kingfishers nest in disused termite nests. A few species, principally insular forms, are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/threatened">threatened</a> with extinction. In Britain, the word kingfisher normally refers to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_kingfisher">common kingfisher</a>.
A hedgehog  is any of the spiny <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mammal">mammal</a>s of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subfamily">subfamily</a> <strong>Erinaceinae</strong>, in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_(biology)">order</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erinaceomorpha">Erinaceomorpha</a>. There are seventeen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/species">species</a> of hedgehog in five <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genus">genera</a>, found through parts of Europe, Asia, Africa and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a> (by introduction). There are no hedgehogs native to Australia, and no living species native to the Americas. Hedgehogs share distant ancestry with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/shrew">shrew</a>s (family Soricidae), with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gymnure">gymnure</a>s possibly being the intermediate link, and have changed little over the last 15 million years.<ref name="13" ways="">Reiter C, Gould GC, <a href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_n6_v107/ai_21031853/?tag=content;col1">&quot;Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Hedgehog&quot;</a> Natural History, Jul&#x2013;Aug 1998</ref> Like many of the first mammals, they have adapted to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nocturnal">nocturnal</a> way of life.(ref: nocturnal)<span class="reference" data-type="web" data-url="http://www.wildlifetrust.org.uk/facts/hedge.htm " data-publisher="WildlifeTrust.org.uk " data-accessdate="2013-02-28">WildlifeTrust.org.uk </span> Hedgehogs&apos; spiny protection resembles that of the unrelated rodent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porcupine">porcupine</a>s and monotreme <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/echidna">echidna</a>s.
The name <em>hedgehog</em> came into use around the mid 15th century (they were earlier known as <em>igls</em>). &quot;Hedge&quot; refers to its usual habitat, the hedgerow, while &quot;hog&quot; refers to its piglike snout, and the snuffling noise it makes whilst foraging. Other names include <em>urchin</em>, <em>hedgepig</em> and <em>furze-pig</em>. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/collective_noun">collective noun</a> for a group of hedgehogs is <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_English_terms_of_venery,_by_animal#H">array</a></em> or <em>prickle</em>.
The common <strong>hippopotamus</strong> (<em>Hippopotamus amphibius</em>), or <strong>hippo</strong>, is a large, mostly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herbivore">herbivorous</a> mammal in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sub-Saharan_Africa">sub-Saharan Africa</a>, and one of only two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extant_taxon">extant</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/species">species</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scientific_classification">family</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippopotamidae">Hippopotamidae</a>, the other being the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pygmy_hippopotamus">pygmy hippopotamus</a> (<em>Choeropsis liberiensis</em> or <em>Hexaprotodon liberiensis</em>).  The name comes from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ancient_Greek">ancient Greek</a> for &quot;river horse&quot; ([grc&#x1F31;&#x3C0;&#x3C0;&#x3BF;&#x3C0;&#x3CC;&#x3C4;&#x3B1;&#x3BC;&#x3BF;&#x3C2;]). After the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/elephant">elephant</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhinoceros">rhinoceros</a>, the common hippopotamus is the third-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Largest_mammals#Even-toed_Ungulates_(Artiodactyla)">largest type of land mammal</a> and the heaviest extant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even-toed_ungulate">artiodactyl</a>. Despite their physical resemblance to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pig">pig</a>s and other terrestrial even-toed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ungulate">ungulate</a>s, the closest living relatives of the Hippopotamidae are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cetacea">cetacea</a>ns (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whale">whale</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porpoise">porpoise</a>s, etc.) from which they diverged about [55million years ago]. The common ancestor of whales and hippos split from other even-toed ungulates around [60million years ago]. The earliest known hippopotamus fossils, belonging to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genus">genus</a> <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenyapotamus">Kenyapotamus</a></em> in Africa, date to around [16million years ago].
Common hippos are recognisable by their barrel-shaped torsos, wide-opening mouths revealing large canine tusks, nearly hairless bodies, columnar-like legs and large size; adults average [1500kglbsabbr=on] and [1300kglbsabbr=on] for males and females respectively, making them the largest species of land mammal after the 3 species of elephants and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_rhinoceros">white</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_rhinoceros">Indian rhinoceros</a>. Despite its stocky shape and short legs, it is capable of running [30km/habbr=on] over short distances. The hippopotamus is a highly aggressive and unpredictable animal and is ranked among the most dangerous animals in Africa.<ref><span class="reference" data-type="web " data-url=" http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/wild/shows-deadly-60/fun-facts/" data-publisher=" &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=" http:="" en.wikipedia.org="" wiki="" national_geographic_(magazine)"_data-national_geographic"="">National Geographic (magazine)&quot; data-National Geographic=&quot;undefined&quot; data-archiveurl=&quot; https://web.archive.org/web/20141016145736/http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/wild/shows-deadly-60/fun-facts/&quot; data-archivedate=&quot; 2014-10-16&quot; data-deadurl=&quot; no&quot;&gt; Deadly 60: 15 Deadly Animal Facts</span></ref> Nevertheless, they are still threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ivory">ivory</a> canine teeth.
The common hippopotamus is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semiaquatic">semiaquatic</a>, inhabiting rivers, lakes and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mangrove">mangrove</a> swamps, where territorial bulls preside over a stretch of river and groups of five to 30 females and young. During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While hippopotamuses rest near each other in the water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory_(animal)">territorial</a> on land.
A <strong>falcon</strong> ([&#x2C8;f&#x254;&#x2D0;lk&#x259;n,_&#x2C8;f&#xE6;l-]) is any one of 37 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/species">species</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bird_of_prey">raptors</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genus">genus</a> <em>Falco</em>, widely distributed on all continents of the world except <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_birds_of_Antarctica">Antarctica</a>.
Adult falcons have thin, tapered wings, which enable them to fly at high speed and to change direction rapidly. Fledgling falcons, in their first year of flying, have longer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/flight_feather">flight feather</a>s, which make their configuration more like that of a general-purpose bird such as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikt:broadwing">broadwing</a>. This makes it easier to fly while learning the exceptional skills required to be effective hunters as adults.
The falcons are the largest genus in the Falconinae subfamily of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falconidae">Falconidae</a>, which itself also includes another subfamily comprising <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caracara">caracara</a>s and a few other species. All these birds kill with their beaks, using a &quot;tooth&quot; on the side of their beaks &#x2014; unlike the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hawk">hawk</a>s, eagles, and other birds of prey in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accipitridae">Accipitridae</a>, which use their feet.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peregrine_falcon">Peregrine falcon</a>s have been recorded diving at speeds of 200 miles per hour (320&#xA0;km/h), making them the fastest-moving creatures on Earth.<ref>&quot;The Speed of Animals&quot; in <em>The New Book of Knowledge</em>, Grolier Academic Reference, 2003, p. 278, ISBN 071720538X</ref> Other falcons include the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gyrfalcon">gyrfalcon</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lanner_falcon">lanner falcon</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/merlin_(bird)">merlin</a>. Some small falcons with long, narrow wings are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hobby_(bird)">hobbies</a>, and some which hover while hunting are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/kestrel_(bird)">kestrels</a>. 
As is the case with many birds of prey, falcons have exceptional powers of vision; the visual acuity of one species has been measured at 2.6 times that of a normal human.
The traditional term for a male falcon is tercel (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_English">British</a> spelling) or tiercel (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English">American</a> spelling), from Latin <em>tertius</em> = <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3_(number)">third</a> because of the belief that only one in three eggs hatched a male bird. Some sources give the etymology as deriving from the fact that a male falcon is about one-third smaller than the female<ref><span class="reference" data-type="web" data-url="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tercel " data-publisher="Dictionary.reference.com " data-accessdate="2010-03-20">tercel </span></ref> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French">Old French</a> <em>tiercelet</em>). A falcon chick, especially one reared for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/falconry">falconry</a>, still in its downy stage is known as an eyas <ref><span class="reference" data-type="web" data-url="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/eyas " data-publisher="Thefreedictionary.com " data-date=" " data-accessdate="2010-03-20">eyas </span></ref><ref><span class="reference" data-type="web" data-url="http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/dictionaries/difficultwords/data/d0005484.html " data-publisher="Tiscali.co.uk " data-date="1964-09-21 " data-accessdate="2010-03-20">Dictionary of Difficult Words &#x2013; eyas</span></ref> (sometimes spelt eyass). The word arose by mistaken division of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_French">Old French</a> <em>un niais</em>, from Latin presumed <em>nidiscus</em> (&quot;nestling&quot;, from <em>nidus</em> = <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nest">nest</a>).

The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triadobatrachus">oldest fossil &quot;proto-frog&quot;</a> appeared in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/early_Triassic">early Triassic</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/molecular_clock">molecular clock dating</a> suggests their origins may extend further back to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permian">Permian</a>, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely distributed, ranging from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tropics">tropics</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subarctic">subarctic</a> regions, but the greatest concentration of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/species_diversity">species diversity</a> is found in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tropical_rainforest">tropical rainforest</a>s. There are approximately 4,800 recorded species, accounting for over 85% of extant amphibian species. They are also one of the five most diverse <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vertebrate">vertebrate</a> orders.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/body_plan">body plan</a> of an adult frog is generally characterized by a stout body, protruding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eye">eye</a>s, cleft <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tongue">tongue</a>, limbs folded underneath, and the absence of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tail">tail</a> in adults. Besides living in fresh water and on dry land, the adults of some species are adapted for living underground or in trees. The skin of the frog is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gland">gland</a>ular, with secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic. Warty species of frog tend to be called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toad">toad</a>s but the distinction between frogs and toads is based on informal naming conventions concentrating on the warts rather than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)">taxonomy</a> or evolutionary history; some toads are more closely related to frogs than to other toads. Frogs&apos; skins vary in colour from well-<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/camouflage">camouflage</a>d dappled brown, grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black to advertise toxicity and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aposematism">warn off predators</a>.
Frogs typically lay their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egg_(biology)">eggs</a> in water. The eggs hatch into aquatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/larva">larva</a>e called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tadpole">tadpole</a>s that have tails and internal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gill">gill</a>s. They have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herbivore">herbivorous</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omnivore">omnivorous</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/planktivore">planktivorous</a> diets. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/biological_life_cycle">life cycle</a> is completed when they <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphosis">metamorphose</a> into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. Frogs are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation">predators</a> and part of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/food_web">food web</a> dynamics of many of the world&apos;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s. The skin is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/semi-permeable">semi-permeable</a>, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce a wide range of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_communication">vocalizations</a>, particularly in their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/breeding_season">breeding season</a>, and exhibit many different kinds of complex <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethology">behaviours</a> to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.
Frog populations have declined significantly since the 1950s. More than one third of species are considered to be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Threatened_species">threatened</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extinct">extinct</a>ion and over one hundred and twenty are believed to have become extinct since the 1980s. The number of malformations among frogs is on the rise and an emerging <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fungus">fungal</a> disease, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chytridiomycosis">chytridiomycosis</a>, has spread around the world. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_biology">Conservation biologists</a> are working to understand the causes of these problems and to resolve them. Frogs are valued as food by humans and also have many cultural roles in literature, symbolism and religion.
<strong>Badgers</strong> are short-legged <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/omnivore">omnivore</a>s in the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustelidae">Mustelidae</a> which also includes the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/otter">otter</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/polecat">polecat</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/weasel">weasel</a>s and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wolverine">wolverine</a>s. They belong to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/caniform">caniform</a> sub-order of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivoran">Carnivoran</a> mammals.
The 11 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/species">species</a> of badger are grouped in three subfamilies: Melinae (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasia">Eurasia</a>n badgers), Mellivorinae (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/honey_badger">honey badger</a> or ratel) and Taxideinae (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_badger">American badger</a>). The Asiatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stink_badger">stink badger</a>s of the genus <em>Mydaus</em> were formerly included within Melinae (and thus Mustelidae), but recent genetic evidence<ref><span class="reference" data-type="book" data-="" author="Goswami, Anjali and Friscia, Anthony " title="Carnivoran Evolution: New Views on Phylogeny, Form and Function" date="2010" publisher="Cambridge University Press" isbn="978-0-521-73586-5" data-page="30"></span></ref> indicates these are actually members of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skunk">skunk</a> family, placing them in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/taxonomic_family">taxonomic family</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephitidae">Mephitidae</a>.
Badgers include the species in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genus">genera</a> <em>Meles</em>, <em>Arctonyx</em>, <em>Taxidea</em> and <em>Mellivora</em>. Their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mandible">lower jaws</a> are articulated to the upper by means of transverse <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandibular_condyle">condyles</a> firmly locked into long cavities of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skull">skull</a>, so dislocation of the jaw is all but impossible. This enables the badgers to maintain their hold with the utmost tenacity, but limits jaw movement to hinging open and shut, or sliding from side to side without the twisting movement possible for the jaws of most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mammal">mammal</a>s.
Badgers have rather short, fat bodies, with short legs for digging. They have elongated weasel-like heads with small ears. Their tails vary in length depending on species; the stink badger has a very short tail, while the ferret badger&apos;s tail can be [46-51cminabbr=on] long, depending on age. They have black faces with distinctive white markings, gray bodies with a light-coloured stripe from head to tail, and dark legs with light coloured underbellies. They grow to around [90cmin] in length including tail. The European badger is one of the largest; the American badger, the hog badger and the honey badger are generally a little smaller and lighter. The stink badgers are smaller still, and the ferret badgers are the smallest of all. They weigh around [9.1-11kglbabbr=on] on average, with some Eurasian badgers weighing in at around [18kglbsabbr=on].<ref><span class="reference" data-type="web" data-="" url="http://www.badgers.org.uk/badgerpages/" archiveurl="https://web.archive.org/web/20120205092802/http://www.badgers.org.uk/badgerpages/" archivedate="5 February 2012" title="Badger Pages: Photos of and facts about the badgers of the world " publisher="Badgers.org.uk " accessdate="31 December 2011"></span></ref>

The <strong>haddock</strong> (<em>Melanogrammus aeglefinus</em>) is a salt water fish, found in the North <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> and associated seas.
The haddock is easily recognized by a black <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lateral_line">lateral line</a> running along its white side (not to be confused with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pollock">pollock</a> which has the reverse, i.e., white line on black side) and a distinctive dark blotch above the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fish_anatomy#Types_of_fin">pectoral fin</a>, often described as a &quot;thumbprint&quot; or even the &quot;Devils thumbprint&quot; or &quot;St. Peters mark&quot;.<ref><a href="http://www.ocean.udel.edu/mas/seafood/haddock.html">Haddock</a></ref>
Haddock is most commonly found at depths of [40to133mftabbr=on], but has a range as deep as [300mftabbr=on]. It thrives in temperatures of 2 to 10&#xA0;&#xB0;C (36 to 50&#xA0;&#xB0;F). Juveniles prefer shallower waters and larger adults deeper water. Generally, adult haddock do not engage in long migratory behaviour as do the younger fish, but seasonal movements have been known to occur across all ages. Haddock feed primarily on small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/invertebrate">invertebrate</a>s, although larger members of the species may occasionally consume fish.
Haddock range in size between 38 to 69 centimeters in length and 0.9 to 1.8 kilograms in weight.(ref: Fisheries and Oceans Canada)<a href="http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/fm-gp/sustainable-durable/fisheries-peches/haddock-aiglefin-eng.htm">Fisheries and Oceans Canada</a>  Growth rates of haddock have changed significantly over the past 30 to 40 years. Presently, growth is more rapid, with haddock reaching their adult size much earlier than previously noted.  However, the degree to which these younger fish contribute to reproductive success of the population is unknown. Growth rates of  haddock, however, had slowed in recent years.

Starfish are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marine_invertebrates">marine invertebrates</a>. They typically have a central disc and five arms, though some species have a larger number of arms. The aboral or upper surface may be smooth, granular or spiny, and is covered with overlapping plates. Many species are brightly coloured in various shades of red or orange, while others are blue, grey or brown. Starfish have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tube_feet">tube feet</a> operated by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_vascular_system">hydraulic system</a> and a mouth at the centre of the oral or lower surface. They are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/opportunistic">opportunistic</a> feeders and are mostly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predation">predators</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/benthic">benthic</a> invertebrates. Several species have specialized feeding behaviours including eversion of their stomachs and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/suspension_feeding">suspension feeding</a>. They have complex <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle">life cycles</a> and can reproduce both sexually and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asexual_reproduction_in_starfish">asexually</a>. Most can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)">regenerate</a> damaged parts or lost arms and they can shed arms as a means of defence. The Asteroidea occupy several significant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecology">ecological</a> roles. Starfish, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ochre_sea_star">ochre sea star</a> (<em>Pisaster ochraceus</em>) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reef_starfish">reef sea star</a> (<em>Stichaster australis</em>), have become widely known as examples of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keystone_species">keystone species</a> concept in ecology. The tropical <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crown-of-thorns_starfish">crown-of-thorns starfish</a> (<em>Acanthaster planci</em>) is a voracious predator of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/coral">coral</a> throughout the Indo-Pacific region, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterias_amurensis">northern Pacific sea star</a> is considered to be one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_the_worlds_100_worst_invasive_species">worlds 100 worst invasive species</a>.
The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fossil">fossil</a> record for starfish is ancient, dating back to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordovician">Ordovician</a> around 450 million years ago, but it is rather poor, as starfish tend to disintegrate after death. Only the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ossicle_(echinoderm)">ossicles</a> and spines of the animal are likely to be preserved, making remains hard to locate. With their appealing symmetrical shape, starfish have played a part in literature, legend, design and popular culture. They are sometimes collected as curios, used in design or as logos, and in some cultures, despite possible toxicity, they are eaten.

Although the name &quot;chimpanzee&quot; is sometimes used to refer to both species together, it is usually understood as referring to the common chimpanzee, whereas <em>Pan paniscus</em> is usually referred to as the bonobo.
The bonobo is distinguished by relatively long legs, pink lips, dark face and tail-tuft through adulthood, and parted long hair on its head. The bonobo is found in a [500000km2sqmiabbr=on] area of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Basin">Congo Basin</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo">Democratic Republic of the Congo</a>, Central Africa.

Political instability in the region and the timidity of bonobos has meant there has been relatively little field work done observing the species in its natural habitat.
Along with the common chimpanzee, the bonobo is the closest extant relative to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human">human</a>s. Because the two species are not proficient swimmers, the formation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_River">Congo River</a> 1.5&#x2013;2 million years ago possibly led to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/speciation">speciation</a> of the bonobo. Bonobos live south of the river, and thereby were separated from the ancestors of the common chimpanzee, which live north of the river. There is no concrete data on population numbers, but the estimate is between 29,500 and 50,000 individuals.

Most species are nonvenomous and those that have venom use it primarily to kill and subdue prey rather than for self-defense.

Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/even-toed_ungulate">even-toed ungulate</a>s. Although the name &quot;sheep&quot; applies to many species in the genus <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovis">Ovis</a></em>, in everyday usage it almost always refers to <em>Ovis aries</em>. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a <em>ewe</em> ([ju&#x2D0;]), an intact male as a <em>ram</em> or occasionally a <em>tup</em>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration">castrated</a> male as a <em>wether</em>, and a younger sheep as a  <em>lamb</em>.
Sheep are most likely descended from the wild <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mouflon">mouflon</a> of Europe and Asia. One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agriculture">agricultural</a> purposes, sheep are raised for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wool">fleece</a>, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sheep_milk">milk</a>. A sheep&apos;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wool">wool</a> is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep_shearing">shearing</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikt:ovine">Ovine</a> meat is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_and_mutton">lamb</a> when from younger animals and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_and_mutton">mutton</a> when from older ones.  Sheep continue to be important for wool and meat today, and are also occasionally raised for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheepskin_(material)">pelts</a>, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dairy">dairy</a> animals, or as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/model_organism">model organism</a>s for science.
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep_husbandry">Sheep husbandry</a> is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations. In the modern era, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a>, the southern and central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America">South America</a>n nations, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles">British Isles</a> are most closely associated with sheep production.
Sheepraising has a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_sheep_husbandry">lexicon of unique terms</a> which vary considerably by region and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dialect">dialect</a>. Use of the word <em>sheep</em> began in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English">Middle English</a> as a derivation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English">Old English</a> word <em>sc&#x113;ap</em>; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal. A group of sheep is called a flock, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herd">herd</a> or mob. Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age.
Being a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symbology">symbology</a>. As livestock, sheep are most often associated with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pastoral">pastoral</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_(utopia)">Arcadian</a> imagery. Sheep figure in many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mythology">mythologies</a>&#x2014;such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece">Golden Fleece</a>&#x2014;and major religions, especially the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic">Abrahamic</a> traditions. In both ancient and modern religious ritual, sheep are used as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_sacrifice">sacrificial animals</a>.

Rattlesnakes are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/predator">predator</a>s that live in a wide array of habitats, hunting small animals such as birds and rodents. 
The threat of envenomation, advertised by the loud shaking of the titular noisemaker (&quot;rattle&quot;) at the end of their tails, deters many predators. However, rattlesnakes fall prey to hawks, weasels, king snakes, and a variety of other species. Rattlesnakes are heavily preyed upon as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/neonate">neonate</a>s, while they are still weak and mentally immature. Large numbers of rattlesnakes are killed by humans. Rattlesnake populations in many areas are severely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/threatened_species">threatened</a> by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/habitat_destruction">habitat destruction</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/poaching">poaching</a>, and extermination campaigns.
Rattlesnake bites are the leading cause of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snakebite">snakebite</a> injuries in North America. However, rattlesnakes rarely bite unless provoked or threatened; if treated promptly, the bites are rarely fatal.

Members of the genus inhabit a range from Africa through the Middle East, India, and Southeast Asia to Indonesia.
Although the king cobra, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiophagus_hannah">Ophiophagus hannah</a></em>, the world&#x2019;s longest venomous snake, is a member of the Elapidae and can raise a rather narrow hood if disturbed, it is not in the genus <em>Naja</em>, and, accordingly, is not a true cobra.
The other cobra of Asia is known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cobra">Asian, Indian or Spectacled cobra</a> (<em>Naja naja</em>) due to the eyeglass-shaped pattern on its skin. The hood of the Asian cobra is larger than that of the king cobra and is usually yellow or brown with a black and white spectacle pattern on top and two black and white spots on the lower surface although albino specimens are also found.<ref>Rylah, Juliet Bennett (4 September 2014) <a href="http://losangeles.cityzine.net/2014/09/04/albino-cobra-continues-its-suburban-reign-of-terror/">&quot;Albino Cobra Continues Its Suburban Reign Of Terror&quot;</a>. <em>Los Angeles Cityzine &#x2013; Your City &#x2013; Your Cityzine</em>.</ref>

Although the bites of some species are extremely dangerous because of their potent neurotoxins, cobras have not been shown to attack people unprovoked. Cobras almost never attack without a threat display, which typically involves raising the hood and hissing.[date=May 2014]
Various species of cobras prey mainly on other snakes, birds and small mammals, while its main natural predators in turn are other snakes, birds of prey, and small predatory mammals such as mongooses. [date=May 2014]
Although most cobras do not make nests, some species protect their eggs until they hatch (incubation typically taking around 60&#xA0;days).[date=May 2014]

Planaria are common to many parts of the world, living in both saltwater and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fresh_water">freshwater</a> ponds and rivers. Some species are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_animal">terrestrial</a> and are found under logs, in or on the soil, and on plants in humid areas.
Some planarians exhibit an extraordinary ability to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)">regenerate</a> lost body parts. For example, a planarian split lengthwise or crosswise will regenerate into two separate individuals. Some planarian species have two eye-spots (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ocellus">ocelli</a>) that can detect the intensity of light, while others have several eye-spots. The eye-spots act as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_eyes_in_invertebrates">photoreceptors</a> and are used to move away from light sources.

The walrus has played a prominent role in the cultures of many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/circumpolar_peoples">indigenous Arctic peoples</a>, who have hunted the walrus for its meat, fat, skin, tusks, and bone. During the 19th century and the early 20th century, walruses were widely hunted and killed for their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blubber">blubber</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/walrus_ivory">walrus ivory</a>, and meat. The population of walruses dropped rapidly all around the Arctic region.

<strong>Whale</strong> is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_name">common name</a> for a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/marine_mammal">marine mammal</a>s. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetacea">Cetacea</a>, excluding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dolphin">dolphin</a>s and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/porpoise">porpoise</a>s, so to zoologists the grouping is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphyly">paraphyletic</a>. The whales comprise the extant families <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetotheriidae">Cetotheriidae</a> (whose only living member is the pygmy right whale), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaenopteridae">Balaenopteridae</a> (the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rorquals">rorquals</a>), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaenidae">Balaenidae</a> (right whales),  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eschrichtiidae">Eschrichtiidae</a> (the gray whale), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monodontidae">Monodontidae</a> (belugas and narwhals), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physeteridae">Physeteridae</a> (the sperm whale), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kogiidae">Kogiidae</a> (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ziphiidae">Ziphiidae</a> (the beaked whales). There are 40 extant species of whales. The two parvorders of whales, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysticeti">Mysticeti</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odontoceti">Odontoceti</a>, are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cetartiodactyla">Cetartiodactyla</a> with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/even-toed_ungulate">even-toed ungulate</a>s and their closest living relatives are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippopotamidae">hippopotamuses</a>, having diverged about 40 million years ago.
Whales range in size from the [2.6mft] and [135kglbs] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dwarf_sperm_whale">dwarf sperm whale</a> to the [34mft] and [190MTST] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blue_whale">blue whale</a>, which is the largest creature on earth. Several species exhibit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexual_dimorphism">sexual dimorphism</a>, in that the females are larger than males. They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers. Though not as flexible or agile as seals, whales can travel at up to 20 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_(unit)">knots</a>. Balaenopterids use their throat pleats to expand the mouth to take in gulps of water. Balaenids have heads that can make up 40% of their body mass to take in water. Odontocetes have conical teeth designed for catching fish or squid. Mysticetes have a well developed sense of &quot;smell&quot;, whereas odontocetes have well-developed hearing &#x2212; their hearing, that is adapted for both air and water, is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. Some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. They have a layer of fat, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/blubber">blubber</a>, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.
Although whales are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth. Odontocetes feed largely on fish and squid. A few, like the sperm whale, feed on large invertebrates, such as giant squid. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_whale">Grey whale</a>s are specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling molluscs. Male whales typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. Whales produce a variety of vocalizations, notably the songs of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humpback_whale">humpback whale</a>.
Once relentlessly hunted for their products, whales are now protected by international law. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Atlantic_right_whale">North Atlantic right whale</a>s nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a population low of 450, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_whale#North_Pacific">North Pacific gray whale population</a> is ranked <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critically_Endangered">Critically Endangered</a> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature">IUCN</a>. Besides whaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The meat, blubber and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/baleen">baleen</a> of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Whales have been depicted in various cultures worldwide, notably by the Inuit and the coastal peoples of Vietnam and Ghana, who sometimes hold whale funerals. Whales occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the great white whale of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville">Herman Melville</a>s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Dick">Moby Dick</a>. Small whales, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/beluga_whale">belugas</a>, are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks, but breeding success has been poor and the animals often die within a few months of capture. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whale_watching">Whale watching</a> has become a form of tourism around the world.

It is found in many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tropical">tropical</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/temperate">temperate</a> waters, and it is especially common around central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific">Pacific</a> islands. Its name derives from the dark stripes down its body which resemble a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiger">tiger</a>&apos;s pattern, which fade as the shark matures.
The tiger shark is a solitary, mostly nocturnal hunter, and is notable for having the widest food spectrum of all sharks, consuming a variety of prey ranging from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/crustacean">crustacean</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fish">fish</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinniped">seals</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bird">bird</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/squid">squid</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/turtle">turtle</a>s, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrophiinae">sea snake</a>s to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dolphin">dolphin</a>s and even other smaller sharks.

Although the name &quot;sheep&quot; applies to many species in the genus <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovis">Ovis</a></em>, in everyday usage it almost always refers to <em>Ovis aries</em>. Numbering a little over one billion, domestic sheep are also the most numerous species of sheep. An adult female sheep is referred to as a <em>ewe</em> ([ju&#x2D0;]), an intact male as a <em>ram</em> or occasionally a <em>tup</em>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castration">castrated</a> male as a <em>wether</em>, and a younger sheep as a  <em>lamb</em>.
Sheep are most likely descended from the wild <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mouflon">mouflon</a> of Europe and Asia. One of the earliest animals to be domesticated for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/agriculture">agricultural</a> purposes, sheep are raised for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wool">fleece</a>, meat (lamb, hogget or mutton) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sheep_milk">milk</a>. A sheep&apos;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wool">wool</a> is the most widely used animal fiber, and is usually harvested by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep_shearing">shearing</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikt:ovine">Ovine</a> meat is called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_and_mutton">lamb</a> when from younger animals and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_and_mutton">mutton</a> when from older ones.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheep_husbandry">Sheep husbandry</a> is practised throughout the majority of the inhabited world, and has been fundamental to many civilizations. In the modern era, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia">Australia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand">New Zealand</a>, the southern and central <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America">South America</a>n nations, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles">British Isles</a> are most closely associated with sheep production.
Sheepraising has a large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_sheep_husbandry">lexicon of unique terms</a> which vary considerably by region and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dialect">dialect</a>. Use of the word <em>sheep</em> began in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_English">Middle English</a> as a derivation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English">Old English</a> word <em>sc&#x113;ap</em>; it is both the singular and plural name for the animal. A group of sheep is called a flock, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/herd">herd</a> or mob. Many other specific terms for the various life stages of sheep exist, generally related to lambing, shearing, and age.
Being a key animal in the history of farming, sheep have a deeply entrenched place in human culture, and find representation in much modern language and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/symbology">symbology</a>. As livestock, sheep are most often associated with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pastoral">pastoral</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arcadia_(utopia)">Arcadian</a> imagery. Sheep figure in many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mythology">mythologies</a>&#x2014;such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Fleece">Golden Fleece</a>&#x2014;and major religions, especially the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrahamic">Abrahamic</a> traditions.

The <strong>bald eagle</strong> (<em>Haliaeetus leucocephalus</em>, from Greek <em>hali</em> &quot;sea&quot;, <em>ai&#x113;tos</em> &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/eagle">eagle</a>&quot;, <em>leuco</em> &quot;white&quot;, <em>cephalos</em> &quot;head&quot;) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bird_of_prey">bird of prey</a> found in North America. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sea_eagle">sea eagle</a>, it has two known subspecies and forms a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_complex">species pair</a> with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/white-tailed_eagle">white-tailed eagle</a> (<em>Haliaeetus albicilla</em>). Its range includes most of Canada and Alaska, all of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/contiguous_United_States">contiguous United States</a>, and northern Mexico. It is found near large bodies of open water with an abundant food supply and old-growth trees for nesting.
The bald eagle is an opportunistic feeder which subsists mainly on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fish">fish</a>, which it swoops down and snatches from the water with its talons. It builds the largest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bird_nest">nest</a> of any North American bird and the largest tree nests ever recorded for any animal species, up to [4mftsp=usabbr = on] deep, [2.5mftsp=usabbr = on] wide, and [1tSTlk = onsp = us] in weight. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_maturity">Sexual maturity</a> is attained at the age of four to five years.
Bald eagles are not actually <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bald">bald</a>; the name derives from an older meaning of &quot;white headed&quot;. The adult is mainly brown with a white head and tail. The sexes are identical in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/plumage">plumage</a>, but females are about 25 percent larger than males.

All damselflies are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/predator">predator</a>y; both nymphs and adults eat other insects. The nymphs are aquatic, with different species living in a variety of freshwater habitats including acid bogs, ponds, lakes and rivers. The nymphs moult repeatedly, at the last moult climbing out of the water to undergo <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/metamorphosis">metamorphosis</a>. The skin splits down the back, they emerge and inflate their wings and abdomen to gain their adult form. Their presence on a body of water indicates that it is relatively unpolluted, but their dependence on freshwater makes them vulnerable to damage to their wetland habitats.
Some species of damselfly have elaborate courtship behaviours. Many species are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sexually_dimorphic">sexually dimorphic</a>, the males often being more brightly coloured than the females. Like dragonflies, they reproduce using indirect <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insemination">insemination</a> and delayed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fertilisation">fertilisation</a>. A mating pair form a shape known as a &quot;heart&quot; or &quot;wheel&quot;, the male clasping the female at the back of the head, the female curling her abdomen down to pick up sperm from secondary genitalia at the base of the male&apos;s abdomen. The pair often remain together with the male still clasping the female while she lays eggs within the tissue of plants in or near water using a robust <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ovipositor">ovipositor</a>.
Fishing flies that mimic damselfly nymphs are sometimes used in wet-fly fishing. Damselflies sometimes provide the subject for personal jewellery such as brooches.

Humans began to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestication">domesticate</a> horses around 4000 BC, and their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/domestication_of_the_horse">domestication</a> is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Horses in the subspecies <em>caballus</em> are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/feral_horse">feral horse</a>s. These feral populations are not true <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wild_horse">wild horse</a>s, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated, such as the endangered <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Przewalski&apos;s_horse">Przewalski&apos;s horse</a>, a separate subspecies, and the only remaining true <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wild_horse">wild horse</a>. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/anatomy">anatomy</a> to life stages, size, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/equine_coat_color">colors</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horse_markings">markings</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/horse_breed">breeds</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/animal_locomotion">locomotion</a>, and behavior.
Horses&apos; anatomy enables them to make use of speed to escape predators and they have a well-developed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrioception">sense of balance</a> and a strong <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fight-or-flight_response">fight-or-flight response</a>. Related to this need to flee from predators in the wild is an unusual trait: horses are able to sleep both standing up and lying down. Female horses, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mare">mare</a>s, carry their young for approximately 11&#xA0;months, and a young horse, called a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/foal">foal</a>, can stand and run shortly following birth. Most domesticated horses begin training under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/saddle">saddle</a> or in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_harness">harness</a> between the ages of two and four. They reach full adult development by age five, and have an average lifespan of between 25 and 30&#xA0;years.
Horse breeds are loosely divided into three categories based on general temperament: spirited &quot;hot bloods&quot; with speed and endurance; &quot;cold bloods&quot;, such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/draft_horse">draft horse</a>s and some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pony">ponies</a>, suitable for slow, heavy work; and &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/warmblood">warmblood</a>s&quot;, developed from crosses between hot bloods and cold bloods, often focusing on creating breeds for specific riding purposes, particularly in Europe. There are more than 300&#xA0;breeds of horse in the world today, developed for many different uses.
Horses and humans interact in a wide variety of sport competitions and non-competitive recreational pursuits, as well as in working activities such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mounted_police">police work</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/working_animal">agriculture</a>, entertainment, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hippotherapy">therapy</a>.

In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_culture">Western</a> societies, the domestic guinea pig has enjoyed widespread popularity as a household <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pet">pet</a> since its introduction by European traders in the 16th century. Their docile nature and responsiveness to handling and feeding, and the relative ease of caring for them, continue to make the guinea pig a popular pet. Organizations devoted to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_fancy">competitive breeding</a> of guinea pigs have been formed worldwide, and many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guinea_pig_breed">specialized breeds</a> of guinea pig, with varying coat colors and compositions, are cultivated by breeders.
Biological experimentation on guinea pigs has been carried out since the 17th century. The animals were frequently used as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/model_organism">model organism</a>s in the 19th and 20th centuries, resulting in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/epithet">epithet</a> &quot;guinea pig&quot; for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human_subject_research">test subject</a>, but have since been largely replaced by other rodents such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Mouse">mice</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Rat">rats</a>.

:<em>This is about the bird also called the ring dove; for other definitions, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_dove_(disambiguation)">Ring dove (disambiguation)</a>.</em>
The <strong>Barbary dove</strong>, <strong>ringed turtle dove</strong>, <strong>ringneck dove</strong>, <strong>ring-necked turtle dove</strong>, or <strong>ring dove</strong> (<em>Streptopelia risoria</em>) is a domestic member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dove">dove</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/family_(biology)">family</a> (Columbidae).
Although the Barbary dove is normally assigned its own systematic name, as <em>Streptopelia risoria</em>, considerable doubt exists as to its appropriate classification. Some sources confidently assert that it is a domestic form of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_collared_dove">Eurasian collared dove</a>, <em>S. decaocto</em>, but the majority of evidence points to it being a domesticated form of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_collared_dove">African collared dove</a>, <em>S. roseogrisea</em>. It appears that it can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_(biology)">hybridise</a> freely with either species, and its status as a species must therefore be regarded as doubtful. However because of the wide use of both the common and systematic names, it is best to consider it separately from either of the putative parent species. Their time of domestication is also is uncertain. While Linnaeus described them in 1756, they may have been imported into Italy from North Africa in the late 16th century.<ref><span class="reference" data-type="book " data-="" author="Fisher, James " year="1953 " title="British Birds, number 5, Vol. XLVI"></span></ref>
Barbary doves are easily kept, and long-lived, in captivity, living for up to 12 years. However, There have been cases of doves living over 20 years,<ref><em>Documented Info by a hobbyist at <a href="">http://diamonddove.info/bird11%20Ringneck.htm</a></em></ref> and at one point a dove living up to 29 years<ref>.<em>Documented story at <a href="">http://diamonddove.info/bird11%20Ringneck.htm</a></em></ref> In recent years they have been used extensively in biological research, particularly into the hormonal bases of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/reproduction">reproductive behaviour</a>, because their sequences of courtship, mating and parental behaviour have been accurately described and are highly consistent in form. Dove fanciers have bred them in a great variety of colours; the number of colours available has increased dramatically in the latter half of the twentieth century, and it is thought that this has been achieved by interbreeding with <em>S. roseogrisea</em>. Some of these doves carry a mutation that makes them completely white. These white Barbaries are most commonly used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stage_magic">stage magic</a> acts.  White Barbary doves are traditionally released in large public ceremonies, since it is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/peace_symbol">peace symbol</a> in several cultures, and &quot;dove releases&quot; are also sometimes found at weddings and funerals. However, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/release_dove">release dove</a> is, in fact, usually a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homing_pigeon">homing pigeon</a>, as Barbary doves lack the homing instinct.

From ca. 1200 AD to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_conquest_of_the_Inca_Empire">Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire</a> in 1532, selective breeding by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_peoples_in_South_America">indigenous South American people</a> resulted in many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/landrace">landrace</a> varieties of domestic guinea pigs, which form the basis for some of the modern, formal breeds.<ref name="walker"><span class="reference" data-type="book " data-="" last=" Nowak " first=" Ronald M.

With the export of guinea pigs to Europe in the 15th century, the goal in breeding shifted to focus on the development of appealing pets. To this end, various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_fancy">competitive breeding</a> organizations were founded by fanciers. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Cavy_Breeders_Association">American Cavy Breeders Association</a>, an adjunct to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Rabbit_Breeders_Association">American Rabbit Breeders Association</a>, is the governing body in the United States and Canada.<ref><span class="reference" data-type="web " data-="" title=" Constitution " url=" http://www.acbaonline.com/constitution.html " publisher=" American Cavy Breeders Association " date=" 2006-09-29 " accessdate=" 2007-03-22"></span></ref> The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Cavy_Council">British Cavy Council</a> governs cavy clubs in the United Kingdom. Similar organizations exist in Australia (Australian National Cavy Council)<ref><span class="reference" data-type="web " data-="" url=" http://cavycouncil.org.au/ " title=" Official Website " publisher=" Australian National Cavy Council " accessdate=" 2012-11-25"></span></ref> and New Zealand (Combined Cavy Clubs New Zealand). Each club publishes its own Standard of Perfection and determines which breeds are eligible for showing. New breeds continue to emerge in the 21st century.
Though there are many breeds of guinea pig, only a few breeds are commonly found on the show table as pets. Most guinea pigs found as pets were either found undesirable[undesirable for showing or as pets?date=March 2013] by breeders or were bred to be pleasant pets regardless of how well they meet the breed standard of perfection. The English/American Short-haired, the Abyssinian (rough-coated), the Peruvian (long-coated), and the Sheltie (a.k.a. Silkie, long-coated) breeds are those most frequently seen as pets, and the former three are the core breeds in the history of the competitive showing of guinea pigs. In addition to their standard form, nearly all breeds come in a Satin variant. Satins, due to their hollow hair shafts, possess coats of a special gloss and shine. However, there is growing evidence that the genes responsible for the satin coat also can cause severe bone problems, including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/osteodystrophy">osteodystrophy</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagets_disease_of_bone">Pagets disease</a>.<ref>Jordan, Julia.  <a href="http://www.diss.fu-berlin.de/diss/receive/FUDISS_thesis_000000003536">&quot;Untersuchungen zur Osteodystrophia fibrosa beim Hausmeerschweinchen&quot; (<em>Cavia aperea</em> f. <em>porcellus</em>) der Z&#xFC;chtung &#x201A;satin&#x2018;&#x200A;&quot;</a> Investigation of Osteodystrophia Fibrosa in Guinea Pigs (Cavia aperea<strong>f. </strong>porcellus<em>) the &quot;Satin&quot; phenotype</em>.

All cavy breeds have some shared general standards: the head profile should be rounded, with large eyes and large, smooth ears. The body should be strong and of compact build. Coat colour should in all variations be clearly defined and thorough from root to tip. These standards are best met by long established, commonly bred breeds, as their breeders have had enough time and animals to effectively breed for these qualities. The coat colour ideal of good definition and thoroughness is rarely met by other than the smooth-coated breeds, which have had well established, separate breeding lines for different colours.

Its main hunting strategy is to trip swift prey such as various <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antelope">antelope</a> species and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hare">hare</a>s with its dewclaw. Almost every facet of the cheetah&apos;s anatomy has evolved to maximise its success in the chase, the result of an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/evolutionary_arms_race">evolutionary arms race</a> with its prey. Due to this specialisation, however, the cheetah is poorly equipped to defend itself against other large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/predator">predator</a>s, with speed being its main means of defence.
In the wild, the cheetah is a prolific breeder, with up to nine cubs in a litter. The majority of cubs do not survive to adulthood, mainly as a result of depredation from other predators. The rate of cub mortality varies from area to area, from 50% to 75%, and in extreme cases such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serengeti">Serengeti</a> ecosystem, up to 90%. Cheetahs are notoriously poor breeders in captivity, though several organizations, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Wildt_Cheetah_and_Wildlife_Centre">De Wildt Cheetah and Wildlife Centre</a>, have succeeded in breeding high numbers of cubs.
The cheetah is listed as vulnerable, facing various threats including: loss of habitat and prey; conflict with humans; the illegal pet trade; competition with and predation by other carnivores; and a gene pool with very low variability. It is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/charismatic_species">charismatic species</a> and many captive cats are &quot;ambassadors&quot; for their species and wildlife conservation in general.

Adult dragonflies are characterized by large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/compound_eye">multifaceted eyes</a>, two pairs of strong transparent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insect_wing">wings</a>, sometimes with coloured patches and an elongated body. Dragonflies can be mistaken for the related group, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damselfly">damselflies</a> (Zygoptera), which are similar in structure, though usually lighter in build; however, the wings of most dragonflies are held flat and away from the body, while damselflies hold the wings folded at rest, along or above the abdomen. Dragonflies are agile fliers, while damselflies have a weaker, fluttery flight. Many dragonflies have brilliant iridescent or metallic colours produced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/structural_coloration">structural coloration</a>, making them conspicuous in flight. An adult dragonfly eye has nearly 24,000 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ommatidium">ommatidia</a>.
Fossils of very large dragonfly ancestors in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protodonata">Protodonata</a> are found from 325&#xA0;million years ago (Mya) in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Carboniferous">Upper Carboniferous</a> rocks; these had wingspans up to about [750mminabbr=on]. About [3000 species] of Anisoptera are in the world today. Most are tropical, with fewer species in temperate regions.
Dragonflies are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/predator">predator</a>s, both in their aquatic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/larva">larva</a>l stage, when they are known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nymph_(biology)">nymphs</a> or naiads, and as adults. Several years of their lives are spent as nymphs living in fresh water; the adults may be on the wing for just a few days or weeks. They are fast, agile fliers, sometimes migrating across oceans, and are often found near water. They have a uniquely complex mode of reproduction involving indirect insemination, delayed fertilization, and sperm competition. During mating, the male grasps the female at the back of the head or on the prothorax, and the female curls her abdomen under her body to pick up sperm from the male&apos;s secondary genitalia at the front of his abdomen, forming the &quot;heart&quot; or &quot;wheel&quot; posture.
Loss of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wetland">wetland</a> habitat threatens dragonfly populations around the world. Dragonflies are represented in human culture on artefacts such as pottery, rock paintings, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Nouveau">Art Nouveau</a> jewellery. They are used in traditional medicine in Japan and China, and caught for food in Indonesia. They are symbols of courage, strength, and happiness in Japan, but seen as sinister in European folklore. Their bright colours and agile flight are admired in the poetry of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred,_Lord_Tennyson">Alfred, Lord Tennyson</a> and the prose of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._E._Bates">H.

They are important as seed dispersers and predators in the ecosystems they inhabit, and are often reared as game birds by humans for their meat and eggs and for recreational hunting.  Many gallinaceous species are skilled runners and escape predators by running rather than flying.  Males of most species are more colorful than the females.  Males often have elaborate courtship behaviors that include strutting, fluffing of tail or head feathers, and vocal sounds. They are mainly nonmigratory.

<strong>A</strong> <strong>kite</strong> is a tethered object with surfaces that react with a fluid (water, air, gas, plasma) to create lift and drag; often the result is flying in air or water of the wing parts of a kite. A kite consists of wings, tethers, and anchors. A kite may be with fixed or moving anchors. There are natural and synthetic kites. Kites have a long and varied history and there are many types of kites that are flown individually and at festivals world wide.
The necessary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force)">lift</a> that sustains the kite in flight is generated when air flows above the kites surface, producing low pressure above and high pressure below the wings.<ref><span class="reference" data-type="web" data-url="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/guided.htm " data-publisher="NASA " data-accessdate="2012-10-03">Beginners Guide to Aeronautics </span></ref> The interaction with the wind also generates horizontal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)">drag</a> along the direction of the wind.

The <strong>impala</strong> (<em>Aepyceros melampus</em>) is a medium-sized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa">Africa</a>n <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/antelope">antelope</a>.
It is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/type_species">type species</a> of the genus <em>Aepyceros</em> and belongs to the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovidae">Bovidae</a>. It was first described by German zoologist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Hinrich_Carl_Lichtenstein">Martin Hinrich Carl Lichtenstein</a> in 1812. Two <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subspecies">subspecies</a> of the impala have been recognised: the common impala (<em>A. m. melampus</em>) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/black-faced_impala">black-faced</a> (<em>A. m. petersi</em>). They are typically between [120-160cminabbr=on] long. Males stand up to approximately [75-92cminabbr=on] at the shoulder and weigh [53-76kglbabbr=on], while females are [70-85cminabbr=on] and [40-53kglbabbr=on]. Both are characterised by a glossy, reddish brown coat. Only the males have the characteristic slender, lyre-shaped <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_(anatomy)">horns</a>, which can grow to be [45-92cminabbr=on] long.
The impala inhabits savanna grasslands and woodlands in close proximity to water sources. It is a mixed forager, whose diet consists of grasses, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forb">forb</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monocot">monocot</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dicot">dicot</a>s and foliage. It switches between grazing and browsing depending on the season and habitat. Water is an essential requirement. Impala are fast runners and are known for their leaping ability, reaching heights up to [3mftabbr=on]. They communicate using a variety of unique visual and vocal cues. There are three distinct social groups during the wet season: the female herds, the bachelor herds and the territorial males. The mating season is the three-week-long period toward the end of the wet season in May. A single fawn is born after a gestational period of about six to seven months. The fawn remains with its mother for four to six months, after which it joins juvenile groups.
The impala is native to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angola">Angola</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botswana">Botswana</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya">Kenya</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malawi">Malawi</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique">Mozambique</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namibia">Namibia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rwanda">Rwanda</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa">South Africa</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swaziland">Swaziland</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzania">Tanzania</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uganda">Uganda</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zambia">Zambia</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimbabwe">Zimbabwe</a>. Regionally extinct in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burundi">Burundi</a>, it has been introduced in two protected areas of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabon">Gabon</a>. The black-faced impala is confined to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaokoland">Kaokoland</a> (Namibia) and southwestern Angola. The common impala has been widely introduced in southern Africa. Though there are no major threats to the survival of the species as a whole, poaching and natural calamities have significantly contributed to the decline of the black-faced subspecies. While the common impala has been listed as of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Least_Concern">Least Concern</a> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_Conservation_of_Nature">International Union for Conservation of Nature</a> (IUCN), the black-faced has been rated as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_species">Vulnerable</a>.

<strong>Locusts</strong> are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/swarm">swarm</a>ing phase of certain species of short-horned <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/grasshopper">grasshopper</a>s in the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrididae">Acrididae</a>. In the solitary phase these grasshoppers are innocuous, their numbers are low and they cause little economic threat to agriculture. However, under suitable conditions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/drought">drought</a> followed by rapid vegetation growth, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/serotonin">serotonin</a> in their brains triggers a dramatic set of changes: they start to breed abundantly, becoming <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gregarious">gregarious</a> and nomadic (loosely described as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_migration">migratory</a>) when their populations become dense enough. They form bands of wingless <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nymph_(biology)">nymphs</a> which later become swarms of winged adults. Both the bands and the swarms move around and rapidly strip fields and cause <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pest_(organism)">damage to crops</a>. The adults are powerful fliers; they can travel great distances, consuming most of the green vegetation wherever the swarm settles.
Locusts have formed plagues since prehistory. The Ancient Egyptians carved them on their tombs and the insects are mentioned in the Bible and the Quran. Swarms have devastated crops and been a contributory cause of famines and human migrations. More recently, changes in agricultural practices and better surveillance of locations where swarms tend to originate, have meant that control measures can be used at an early stage. The traditional means of control are based on the use of insecticides from the ground or the air, but other methods using biological control are proving effective. 
Swarming behaviour has decreased in the twentieth century, but despite modern surveillance and control methods, the potential for swarms to form is still present, and when suitable climatic conditions occur and vigilance lapses, plagues can still occur. Locusts are large insects and convenient for use in research and the study of zoology in the classroom.

<strong>Mackerel</strong> is a common name applied to a number of different species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pelagic_fish">pelagic fish</a>, mostly, but not exclusively, from the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scombridae">Scombridae</a>. They are found in both temperate and tropical seas, mostly living along the coast or offshore in the oceanic environment.
 
Mackerel typically have vertical stripes on their backs and deeply forked tails. Many species are restricted in their distribution ranges, and live in separate populations or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fish_stock">fish stock</a>s based on geography. Some stocks <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_migration">migrate</a> in large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling">schools</a> along the coast to suitable spawning grounds, where they spawn in fairly shallow waters. After spawning they return the way they came, in smaller schools, to suitable feeding grounds often near an area of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/upwelling">upwelling</a>. From there they may move offshore into deeper waters and spend the winter in relative inactivity. Other stocks migrate across oceans.

The <strong>sperm whale</strong> (<em>Physeter macrocephalus</em>), or <strong>cachalot</strong>, is the largest of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/toothed_whale">toothed whale</a>s and the largest toothed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/predator">predator</a>. It is the only living member of genus <strong><em>Physeter</em></strong>, and one of three extant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/species">species</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sperm_whale_family">sperm whale family</a>, along with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pygmy_sperm_whale">pygmy sperm whale</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dwarf_sperm_whale">dwarf sperm whale</a> of the genus <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kogia">Kogia</a></em>.
The sperm whale can be found anywhere in the open ocean.  Females and young males live together in groups while mature males live solitary lives outside of the mating season. The females cooperate to protect and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lactation">nurse</a> their young. Females give birth every four to twenty years, and care for the calves for more than a decade. A mature sperm whale has few natural predators. Calves and weakened adults are taken by pods of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/orcas">orcas</a>.
From the early eighteenth century through the late 20th, the species was a prime target of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/whaling">whalers</a>. The head of the whale contains a liquid wax called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spermaceti">spermaceti</a>, from which the whale derives its name.  Spermaceti was used in lubricants, oil lamps, and candles. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambergris">Ambergris</a>, a waste product from its digestive system, is still used as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fixative_(perfumery)">fixative</a> in perfumes. Occasionally the sperm whale&apos;s great size allowed it to defend itself effectively against whalers. The species is now protected by a whaling moratorium, and is currently listed as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/vulnerable_species">vulnerable</a> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Union_for_the_Conservation_of_Nature_and_Natural_Resources">IUCN</a>.

<strong>Apes</strong> (<strong>Hominoidea</strong>) are a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clade">branch</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World">Old World</a> tailless <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian">anthropoid</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catarrhine">catarrhine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/primate">primate</a>s native to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africa">Africa</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia">Southeast Asia</a>. They are distinguished from other primates by a wider degree of freedom of motion at the shoulder joint as evolved by the influence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/brachiation">brachiation</a>. There are two extant branches of the superfamily <strong>Hominoidea</strong>: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gibbon">gibbon</a>s, or lesser apes; and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hominid">hominid</a>s, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_apes">great apes</a>.
Members of the superfamily <strong>Hominoidae</strong> are called <strong>hominoids</strong>&#x2014;which term is not to be confused with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hominid">hominid</a>s, the family of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/great_ape">great ape</a>s; or with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hominin">hominin</a>s, the tribe of humans also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_human_clade">the human clade</a>; or with other very similar terms of primate taxa. (Compare <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hominidae#Terminology">terminology of primate names</a>.)
Recent evidence has changed our understanding of the relationships between the hominoids, especially regarding the human lineage; and the traditionally used terms have become somewhat confused. Competing approaches re methodology and terminology are found among current scientific sources. See below, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/#History_of_hominoid_taxonomy">History of hominoid taxonomy</a> and see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate#Historical_and_modern_terminology">Primate: Historical and modern terminology</a> for discussions of the changes in scientific classification and terminology regarding hominoids.
Some and, recently, all, <strong>hominoids</strong> are also called &quot;<strong>apes</strong>&quot;, but the term is used broadly and has several different senses within both popular and scientific settings. &quot;Ape&quot; has been used as a synonym for &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monkey">monkey</a>&quot; or for naming any primate with a humanlike appearance, particularly those without a tail. Thus the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_macaque">Barbary macaque</a>, a kind of monkey, is popularly called the &quot;Barbary ape&quot;. Biologists have traditionally used the term &quot;ape&quot; to mean a member of the superfamily Hominoidea <em>other than</em> humans, but more recently to mean <em>all</em> members of Hominoidea. So &quot;ape&quot;&#x2014;not to be confused with &quot;great ape&quot;&#x2014;now becomes another word for <strong>hominoid</strong> <em>including</em> humans.
Except for gorillas and humans, hominoids are agile climbers of trees. Their diet is best described as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/frugivorous">frugivorous</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/folivorous">folivorous</a>, consisting mainly of fruit, nuts, seeds, including grass seeds, leaves, and in some cases other animals, either hunted or scavenged, or (solely in the case of the humans) farmed&#x2014;along with anything else available and easily digested.<ref><span class="reference" data-type="web" data-url="http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14926-loving-bonobos-have-a-carnivorous-dark-side.html#.VHXsaclWqUU" data-last="Callaway" data-first="Ewen" data-date="13 October 2006" data-work="&lt;a href=" http:="" en.wikipedia.org="" wiki="" new_scientist"="">New Scientist&quot; data-accessdate=&quot;26 November 2014&quot;&gt;Loving bonobos have a carnivorous dark side</span></ref><ref><span class="reference" data-type="web" data-url="http://www.nature.com/news/humans-are-becoming-more-carnivorous-1.14282" data-last="Hoag" data-first="Hannah" data-date="2 December 2013" data-work="&lt;a href=" http:="" en.wikipedia.org="" wiki="" nature_(journal)"_data-nature"="">Nature (journal)&quot; data-Nature=&quot;undefined&quot; data-accessdate=&quot;26 November 2014&quot;&gt;Humans are becoming more carnivorous</span></ref>
Most non-human hominoids are rare or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/endangered_species">endangered</a>.

Oxen are used for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plough">plow</a>ing, for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/transport">transport</a> (pulling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/cart">cart</a>s, hauling <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wagon">wagon</a>s and even riding), for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/threshing">threshing</a> grain by trampling, and for powering machines that grind grain or supply <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/irrigation">irrigation</a> among other purposes. Oxen may be also used to skid logs in forests, particularly in low-impact, select-cut <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/logging">logging</a>.
Oxen are usually yoked in pairs. Light work such as carting household items on good roads might require just one pair, while for heavier work, further pairs would be added as necessary. A team used for a heavy load over difficult ground might exceed nine or ten pairs.
The <strong>jaguar</strong> ([&#x2C8;d&#x292;&#xE6;&#x261;ju&#x2D0;&#x259;r,_&#x2C8;d&#x292;&#xE6;&#x261;j&#x28A;&#x259;r,_&#x2C8;d&#x292;&#xE6;&#x261;ju&#x2D0;&#x251;r] or [&#x2C8;d&#x292;&#xE6;&#x261;w&#x251;r]), <strong><em>Panthera onca</em></strong>, is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/big_cat">big cat</a>, a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/felidae">feline</a> in the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthera">Panthera</a></em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genus">genus</a>, and is the only <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/extant_taxon">extant</a> <em>Panthera</em> species native to the Americas. The jaguar is the third-largest feline after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/tiger">tiger</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lion">lion</a>, and the largest in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas">Americas</a>. The jaguar&apos;s present range extends from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southwestern_United_States">Southwestern United States</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico">Mexico</a> across much of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_America">Central America</a> and south to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraguay">Paraguay</a> and northern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina">Argentina</a>. Apart from a known and possibly breeding population in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arizona">Arizona</a> (southeast of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tucson">Tucson</a>) and the bootheel of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico">New Mexico</a>, the cat has largely been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_extinction">extirpated</a> from the United States since the early 20th century.
This spotted cat most closely resembles the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/leopard">leopard</a> physically, although it is usually larger and of sturdier build and its behavioral and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/habitat_(ecology)">habitat</a> characteristics are closer to those of the tiger. While dense <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_and_subtropical_moist_broadleaf_forests">rainforest</a> is its preferred habitat, the jaguar will range across a variety of forested and open terrains. It is strongly associated with the presence of water and is notable, along with the tiger, as a feline that enjoys swimming. The jaguar is largely a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wiktionary:solitary">solitary</a>, opportunistic, stalk-and-ambush <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/predator">predator</a> at the top of the food chain (an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/apex_predator">apex predator</a>). It is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/keystone_species">keystone species</a>, playing an important role in stabilizing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ecosystem">ecosystem</a>s and regulating the populations of the animals it hunts. The jaguar has an exceptionally powerful bite, even relative to the other big cats. This allows it to pierce the shells of armored reptiles and to employ an unusual killing method: it bites directly through the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/skull">skull</a> of prey between the ears to deliver a fatal bite to the brain.
The jaguar is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/near_threatened">near threatened</a> species and its numbers are declining. Threats include loss and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fragmentation_of_habitat">fragmentation of habitat</a>. While international trade in jaguars or their parts is prohibited, the cat is still frequently killed by humans, particularly in conflicts with ranchers and farmers in South America. Although reduced, its range remains large. Given its historical distribution, the jaguar has featured prominently in the mythology of numerous <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas">indigenous American cultures</a>, including those of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization">Maya</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aztec">Aztec</a>.
<strong>Flamingos</strong> (or <strong>flamingoes</strong><ref>Both forms of the plural are attested, according to the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxford_English_Dictionary">Oxford English Dictionary</a></em></ref>) are a type of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wading_bird">wading bird</a> in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/family_(biology)">family</a> <strong>Phoenicopteridae</strong>. There are four flamingo species in the Americas and two species in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afro-Eurasia">Afro-Eurasia</a>. Often, they are pink in colour.
<strong>Sparrows</strong> are a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/family_(biology)">family</a> of small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/passerine">passerine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bird">bird</a>s, <strong>Passeridae</strong>. They are also known as <strong>true sparrows</strong>, or <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_World">Old World</a> sparrows</strong>, names also used for a particular <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genus">genus</a> of the family, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passer">Passer</a></em>. They are distinct from both the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_sparrow">American sparrow</a>s, in the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emberizidae">Emberizidae</a>, and from a few other birds sharing their name, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_sparrow">Java sparrow</a> of the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrildidae">Estrildidae</a>. Many species nest on buildings, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_sparrow">house</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurasian_tree_sparrow">Eurasian tree sparrow</a>s in particular inhabit cities in large numbers, so sparrows may be the most familiar of all wild birds. They are primarily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seed">seed-eaters</a>, though they also consume small <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/insect">insect</a>s. Some species scavenge for food around cities and, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gull">gull</a>s or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rock_dove">rock dove</a>s, will happily eat virtually anything in small quantities.
<strong>Herring</strong> are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/forage_fish">forage fish</a>, mostly belonging to the family <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clupeidae">Clupeidae</a>.
They often move in large <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoaling_and_schooling">schools</a> around <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fishing_bank">fishing bank</a>s and near the coast. The most abundant and commercially important species belong to the genus <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clupea">Clupea</a></em>, found particularly in shallow, temperate waters of the North <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean">Pacific</a> and the North <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean">Atlantic</a> oceans, including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baltic_Sea">Baltic Sea</a>, as well as off the west coast of South America. Three species of <em>Clupea</em> are recognised, and provide about 90% of all herrings captured in fisheries. Most abundant of all is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlantic_herring">Atlantic herring</a>, providing over half of all herring capture. Fishes called herring are also found in India, in the Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean and Bay of Bengal.

Two species of hookworms commonly infect humans: <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancylostoma_duodenale">Ancylostoma duodenale</a></em> and <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necator_americanus">Necator americanus</a></em>. <em>A. duodenale</em> predominates in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East">Middle East</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa">North Africa</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India">India</a> and (formerly) in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/southern_Europe">southern Europe</a>, while <em>N. americanus</em> predominates in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/the_Americas">the Americas</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-Saharan_Africa">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southeast_Asia">Southeast Asia</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China">China</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia">Indonesia</a>. <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancylostoma_tubaeforme">A. tubaeforme</a></em> infects cats, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancylostoma_caninum">A. caninum</a></em> infects dogs and <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancylostoma_braziliense">A. braziliense</a></em> and <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncinaria_stenocephala">Uncinaria stenocephala</a></em> infect both cats and dogs.  Hookworms are much smaller than the giant roundworms <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascaris_lumbricoides">Ascaris lumbricoides</a></em> and so cause less tissue damage and obstruction.

The <strong>herons</strong> are long-legged freshwater and coastal <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bird">bird</a>s in the family <strong>Ardeidae</strong>, with 64 recognised <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/species">species</a> (some are called <em>&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/egret">egret</a>s&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/bittern">bittern</a>s&quot;</em> instead of &quot;heron&quot;). Within Ardeidae, all members of the genera <em>Botaurus</em> and <em>Ixobrychus</em> are referred to as &quot;bitterns&quot;, and&#x2014;including the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/zigzag_heron">zigzag heron</a> or zigzag bittern&#x2014;are a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monophyletic">monophyletic</a> group within the Ardeidae. However, egrets are not a biologically distinct group from the herons, and tend to be named differently because they are mainly white or have decorative plumes. Although egrets have the same build as herons, they tend to be smaller.
The classification of the individual heron/egret species is fraught with difficulty, and there is still no clear consensus about the correct placement of many species into either of the two major genera, <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardea_(genus)">Ardea</a></em> and <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egretta">Egretta</a></em>. Similarly, the relationship of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/genus">genera</a> in the family is not completely resolved.

Although herons resemble birds in some other families, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/stork">stork</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ibis">ibis</a>es, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spoonbill">spoonbill</a>s and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crane_(bird)">cranes</a>, they differ from these in flying with their necks retracted, not outstretched.

A <strong>land snail</strong> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/common_name">common name</a> for any of the numerous species of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/snail">snail</a> that live on land, as opposed to those that live in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater">salt water</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fresh_water">fresh water</a>. Land snails are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/terrestrial_animal">terrestrial</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gastropod">gastropod</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mollusk">mollusk</a>s that have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gastropod_shell">shells</a> (those without shells are known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slug">slug</a>s). In reality however, it is not always easy to say which species are terrestrial, because some are more or less <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphibian">amphibious</a> between land and freshwater, and others are relatively amphibious between land and saltwater.
The majority of land snails are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pulmonate">pulmonate</a>s, i.e. they have a lung and breathe air. A minority however belong to much more ancient <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lineage_(evolution)">lineages</a> where their anatomy includes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gill">gill</a> and an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/operculum_(gastropod)">operculum</a>. Many of these operculate land snails live in habitats or microhabitats that are sometimes (or often) damp or wet, such as for example in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/moss">moss</a>.
Land snails have a strong muscular foot; they use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/mucus">mucus</a> to enable them to crawl over rough surfaces, and in order to keep their soft bodies from drying out. Like other mollusks, land snails have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(mollusc)">mantle</a>, and they have one or two pairs of tentacles on their head. Their internal anatomy includes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/radula">radula</a> and a primitive brain.
In terms of reproduction, the majority of land snails are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hermaphrodite">hermaphrodite</a> (have a full set of organs of both sexes) and most lay clutches of eggs in the soil. Tiny snails hatch out of the egg with a small shell in place, and the shell grows spirally as the soft parts gradually increase in size. Most land snails have shells that are right-handed in their coiling.
A wide range of different vertebrate and invertebrate animals prey on land snails, and they are used as food by humans in various cultures worldwide, and are even raised on farms as food in some areas.

<strong>Lemurs</strong> ([audio=En-us-Lemur.ogg&#x2C8;li&#x2D0;m&#x259;r] [LEEm&#x259;r]) are a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clade">clade</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strepsirrhini">strepsirrhine</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/primate">primate</a>s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/endemism">endemic</a> to the island of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madagascar">Madagascar</a>. The word &quot;lemur&quot; derives from the word <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/lemures">lemures</a></em> (ghosts or spirits) from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_mythology">Roman mythology</a> and was first used to describe a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slender_loris">slender loris</a> due to its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnality">nocturnal</a> habits and slow pace, but was later applied to the primates on Madagascar. Although lemurs often are confused with ancestral primates, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simian">anthropoid</a> primates (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/monkey">monkey</a>s, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ape">ape</a>s, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/human">human</a>s) did not evolve from them; instead, lemurs merely share morphological and behavioral traits with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basal_(phylogenetics)">basal</a> primates. Lemurs arrived in Madagascar around 62 to 65&#xA0;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#Symbols_y_and_yr">mya</a> by rafting on mats of vegetation at a time when ocean currents favored <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oceanic_dispersal">oceanic dispersal</a> to the island. Since that time, lemurs have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution">evolved</a> to cope with an extremely seasonal environment and their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/adaptation">adaptation</a>s give them a level of diversity that rivals that of all other primate groups. Until shortly after humans arrived on the island around 2,000&#xA0;years ago, there were lemurs as large as a male <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gorilla">gorilla</a>. Today, there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_lemur_species">nearly 100 species of lemurs</a>, and most of those species have been discovered or promoted to full species status since the 1990s; however, lemur <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomy_(biology)">taxonomic classification</a> is controversial and depends on which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_problem">species concept</a> is used.  Even the higher-level taxonomy is disputed, with some experts preferring to place most lemurs within the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank">infraorder</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemuriformes">Lemuriformes</a>, while others prefer Lemuriformes to contain all living strepsirrhines, placing all lemurs in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank">superfamily</a> <strong>Lemuroidea</strong> and all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/loris">loris</a>es and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/galago">galago</a>s in superfamily <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorisoidea">Lorisoidea</a>.[name=LemuriformesAlthough the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monophyly">monophyletic relationship</a> between lemurs and lorisoids is widely accepted, their clade name is not. The term &quot;lemuriform&quot; is used here because it derives from one popular taxonomy that clumps the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/clade">clade</a> of toothcombed primates into one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank">infraorder</a> and the extinct, non-toothcombed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapiformes">adapiforms</a> into another, both within the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank">suborder</a> Strepsirrhini.{{SfnSzalayDelson1980p=149][Cartmill2010p=15] However, another popular alternative taxonomy places the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorisoidea">lorisoids</a> in their own infraorder, Lorisiformes.[Hartwig2011pp=20&#x2013;21]}}
Ranging in weight from 30&#xA0;g (1.1&#xA0;oz) to 9&#xA0;kg (20&#xA0;lb), lemurs share many common, basal primate traits, such as divergent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/digit_(anatomy)">digits</a> on their hands and feet and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/nail_(anatomy)">nails</a> instead of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/claw">claw</a>s (in most species). However, their <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain-to-body_mass_ratio">brain-to-body size ratio</a> is smaller than that of anthropoid primates, and among many other traits they share with other strepsirrhine primates, they have a &quot;wet nose&quot; (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/rhinarium">rhinarium</a>). Lemurs are generally the most social of the strepsirrhine primates and communicate more with scents and vocalizations than with visual signals. Many lemur adaptations are in response to Madagascar&apos;s highly seasonal environment. Lemurs have relatively low <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/basal_metabolic_rate">basal metabolic rate</a>s and may exhibit <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seasonal_breeder">seasonal breeding</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dormancy">dormancy</a> (such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hibernation">hibernation</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/torpor">torpor</a>), or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dominance_(ethology)">female social dominance</a>. Most eat a wide variety of fruits and leaves, while some are specialists.  Although many share similar diets, different species of lemur share the same forests by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/niche_differentiation">differentiating niches</a>.
